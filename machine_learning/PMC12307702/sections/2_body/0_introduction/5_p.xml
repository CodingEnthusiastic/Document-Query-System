Furthermore, existing investigations do not assess performance at the individual cell level. For instance, one study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> has performed pixel-level evaluation of AI predictions or correlated the total number of detected nuclei with manual counts, without verifying whether the same individual cells were correctly identified. This gap is critical because simply relying on the final number of detected cells or the calculated Ki67 score can lead to overlooking inaccuracies in identifying the correct cells. Assessing performance at the cell level ensures that the image analysis tools detect the correct cells, rather than achieving seemingly accurate counts despite incorrect detections.</p>
