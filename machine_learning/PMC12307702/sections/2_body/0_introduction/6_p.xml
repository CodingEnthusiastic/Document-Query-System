The performance of the employed tools was assessed by comparing not only the calculated Ki67 scores and the number of detected (total and Ki67 positive) tumor cells, but also by measuring the spatial distance between the tumor cells identified by the image analysis tools and those annotated by a gastrointestinal pathologist (SL) aiming to determine whether the correct cells were identified.</p>
