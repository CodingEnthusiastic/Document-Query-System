These neoplasms often show a characteristic morphology and express general markers of neuroendocrine differentiation, such as synaptophysin and chromogranin. Biological behavior and response to therapy are dependent on the site of origin, grade of differentiation, and proliferation rate. In particular, proliferation is a critical factor for the prognosis of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms originating from the digestive tract, known as neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), as differentiation alone does not provide prognostic information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Consequently, the WHO&#8217;s classification of NETs in the digestive tract is based on the proliferation rate.</p>
