Digital image analysis can be a reproducible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and faster alternative to manual scoring of Ki67. Several studies have reported on the automated estimation of the Ki67 score in different malignancies, like breast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>colorectal carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>and NETs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, the application of digital pathology still faces challenges, such as (i) distinguishing tumor from non-tumor cells, (ii) proper cell segmentation (dealing with overlapping tumor cells and inhomogeneous staining), and (iii) discerning Ki67 positive from negative tumor cells (with respect to choosing a threshold for positivity).</p>
