<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Evaluating the performance of computational detection of all tumor cells. (<bold>a</bold>) Scatterplot and fitted regression lines comparing the total number of detected tumor cells between the reference standard (x-axis) and the image analysis tools (y-axis, ImageScope: blue, Aiforia: red). Each dot indicates the tumor cell count in one of the 80 ROIs in the test dataset. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) represents the extent of agreement between the image analysis tools and the reference standard in detecting the total number of tumor cells. The formula of the regression line between the total number of detected tumor cells by each image analysis and the reference standard is shown. This formula provides insights into the linear association between the two measurements. (<bold>b</bold>) Strip chart comparing a set of performance metrics (false discovery rate (FDR), Precision, Recall, F-score) between the two image analysis tools. Each pair of points are linked by a purple line. <italic>P</italic>-values represent the result of paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests. The median for each set of data points is drawn as a short black line on the datapoints. (<bold>c</bold>&#8211;<bold>e</bold>) A single region of interest, the scale bar represents 60&#160;&#956;m. (<bold>d</bold>&#8211;<bold>e</bold>) Visualizing total tumor cell detection by the reference standard (black squares) and ImageScope (in <bold>d</bold>, blue circles), and Aiforia (in e, red circles). It is a true positive (TP) detection, for tumor cells, if both the reference standard and the image analysis detection markings are placed on the same cell. A stand-alone black square is a false negative (FN) detection, for tumor cells, and a stand-alone blue (or red) circle is a false positive (FP) detection, for tumor cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2025_8778_Fig3_HTML" id="d33e648"/></fig>
