Additionally, ImageScope sometimes misidentified overlapping tumor cells as one large cell, leading to FN detection (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, Supplementary Table S3 for detailed counts of tumor cells). In some cases, the Aiforia algorithm appeared slightly conservative, causing it to miss some true tumor cells, resulting in FN detection (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, e).</p>
