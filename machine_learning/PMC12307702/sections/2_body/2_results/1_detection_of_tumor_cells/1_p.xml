The first stage focused on the detection of total (Ki67 positive and Ki67 negative) tumor cells. When examining the number of detected total tumor cells per ROI, the comparisons of ImageScope and Aiforia against the reference standard revealed moderate and excellent agreement, respectively, with ICC&#8201;=&#8201;0.62 (95% CI, 0.44&#8211;0.75) and p-value&#8201;=&#8201;0.0003 (paired Wilcoxon signed rank test) and ICC&#8201;=&#8201;0.91 (95% CI, 0.86&#8211;0.94) and p-value&#8201;=&#8201;0.0425 (paired Wilcoxon signed rank test) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Out of the 80 ROIs, Aiforia over-counted the total number of tumor cells in 65% (52/80) and under-counted in 35% (28/80), whereas ImageScope over-counted in 70% (56/80) and under-counted in 30% (24/80) (Supplementary Table S3 for detailed counts of tumor cells). While the agreement between Aiforia and the reference standard did not reach the same level as that observed in the intra-observer experiment (ICC&#8201;=&#8201;0.98, 95% CI, 0.97&#8211;0.99. Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), the results still indicated that Aiforia performed significantly better than ImageScope did.</p>
