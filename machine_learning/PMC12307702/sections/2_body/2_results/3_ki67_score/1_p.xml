The agreement between ImageScope and the reference standard was poor, with an ICC&#8201;=&#8201;0.45 (95% CI, 0.09&#8211;0.66). However, Aiforia showed superior agreement with an ICC&#8201;=&#8201;0.86 (95% CI, 0.73&#8211;0.92). Out of the 80 ROIs, Aiforia over-estimated the score in 59% (47/80; in some ROIs the image analysis tool counted the Ki67 positive non-tumor cells, or faintly stained tumor cells as Ki67 positive tumor cells), under-estimated in 21% (17/80; in some ROIs the image analysis tool counted more cells by including several non-tumor cells, while counting the same number of positive tumor cells), and provided concordant results in 20% (16/80; all 16 ROIs had no Ki67 positive cells). Whereas ImageScope over-estimated the score in 76% (61/80), under-estimated in 8% (6/80), and gave concordant results in 16% (13/80; all 13 ROIs had no Ki67 positive tumor cells) of ROIs. Notably, that there was one change in grade (for case number 3) in our test dataset by non-ML analysis, compared with the reference standard. None of the cases analyzed by the ML method changed in grade (Supplementary Table S3 and S4 for individual scores of the cases).</p>
