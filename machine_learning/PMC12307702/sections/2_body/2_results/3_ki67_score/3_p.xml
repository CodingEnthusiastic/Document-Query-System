<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Bland-Altman plot showing the agreement of Ki67 scores between the reference standard (RS) and ImageScope (IS) or Aiforia (AI). The black bold line represents the bias line. The dashed lines are limits of agreement. The x axis shows the average of the score measurements. The y axis shows the difference between the measured scores. (<bold>a</bold>) Agreement between the Ki67 score measured by the reference standard and ImageScope and (<bold>b</bold>) Aiforia for the 80 data points, representing the 80 ROIs in the test dataset. Aiforia has narrower limits of agreements, and its median line is closer to the zero line.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2025_8778_Fig5_HTML" id="d33e755"/></fig>
