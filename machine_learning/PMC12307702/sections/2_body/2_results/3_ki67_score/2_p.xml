The plots display the means of the scores on the x axis and the differences in the scores on the y axis for each of the 80 ROIs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and 10 cases (Supplementary Fig. S4). In both plots, the median line and most data points were below zero, indicating that both image analysis tools over-estimated the Ki67 score compared with the reference standard. Some outliers were observed both below and above the limits of agreement. Aiforia has narrower limits of agreements, and its median line is closer to zero. This finding suggests that when comparing the Ki67 scores with the reference standard, Aiforia demonstrated better agreement and reliability than ImageScope.</p>
