While Aiforia exhibited a slightly more conservative approach than ImageScope in detecting positively Ki67-stained tumor cells, it still counted more compared to the reference standard (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Based on the number of detected Ki67 positive tumor cells, four performance metrics were calculated for each case. While Aiforia generally showed better values in three out of the four measures (FDR, precision, and F-score), the differences in performance between Aiforia and ImageScope were not statistically significant (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).</p>
