<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Evaluating the performance of computational detection of Ki67 positive tumor cells. (<bold>a</bold>) Scatterplot showing the distribution of the detected Ki67 positive tumor cells by the reference standard (black squares), ImageScope (blue circles), and Aiforia (red circles), each set of points (linked by a purple line) shows the result across the 10 cases, where an individual point indicates the sum of Ki67 positive tumor cell counts in the eight ROIs for the respective case. (<bold>b</bold>) Strip chart comparing a set of performance metrics (false discovery rate (FDR), precision, recall, F-score) between the two image analysis tools. Each pair of points (linked by a purple line) represents the sum of Ki67 positive tumor cell counts for one of the 10 cases with the respective tool (ImageScope: blue, Aiforia: red). <italic>P</italic>-values represent the results of paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests. The median for each set of data points is drawn as a short black line on the datapoints. (<bold>c</bold>&#8211;<bold>e</bold>) A single region of interest, the scale bar is 60&#160;&#956;m. (<bold>d</bold>&#8211;<bold>e</bold>) Visualization of Ki67 positive tumor cell detection by reference standard (black squares), ImageScope (in<bold> d</bold>, with blue circles), and Aiforia (in<bold> e</bold>, with red circles). It is a true positive (TP) detection, of a Ki67 positive tumor cell, if both the reference standard and the image analysis detection markings are placed on the same cell. A stand-alone black square is a false negative (FN) detection, for a Ki67 positive tumor cell, and a stand-alone blue (or red) circle is a false positive (FP) detection, for a Ki67 positive tumor cell.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2025_8778_Fig4_HTML" id="d33e717"/></fig>
