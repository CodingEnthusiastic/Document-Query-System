The agreement of ImageScope and Aiforia with the reference standard was poor and moderate, respectively, with ICC&#8201;=&#8201;0.24 (95% CI, 0.005&#8211;0.44) and ICC&#8201;=&#8201;0.70 (95% CI, 0.46&#8211;0.82). Out of the 80 ROIs, Aiforia over-counted the number of Ki67 positive tumor cells in 51% (41/80), under-counted in 6% (5/80), and got matching results in 43% (34/80), whereas ImageScope over-counted in 70% (56/80) and obtained matching results with the reference standard in 30% (24/80) of the ROIs (Supplementary Table S4).</p>
