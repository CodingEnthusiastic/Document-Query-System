Some studies have explored the reliability of Ki67 scores when averaging several smaller hotspots or using a single larger hotspot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>while others have employed automatic hotspots selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Since the Ki67 score is affected both by the number and size of chosen hotspots, any differences in these parameters between the compared methods could make direct comparison unreliable. In light of these issues, we chose to use the term ROI rather than the term hotspot and decided to define ROIs with a standard size containing approximately 200 cells, which was considered adequate to meet the aim of this study &#8211; to compare performance&#8217;s accuracy of two image analysis tools in cell level.</p>
