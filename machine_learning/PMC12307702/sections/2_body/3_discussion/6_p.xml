Specifically, in the presence of lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and stromal cells, the algorithm would frequently have difficulty distinguishing tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). Depending on the distribution of cell types within a sample, this issue would frequently lead to the over-counting of tumor cells (Supplementary Table S3 and S4 for detailed counts of tumor cells). Non-ML-based analysis tools typically operate with a set of predefined parameters, and thus lack flexibility and adaptability when dealing with complex tasks. One possible solution to address this issue is to limit the scope of analysis, for example to analyze only tumor areas. Using a similar method, Volynskaya et al.. reported that their ImageScope analysis correlated with the pathologists&#8217; results, after manual removal of the stroma within the analyzed regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. While such an approach can improve the analysis results by excluding most non-tumor cells from the analysis, it is more time-consuming and requires domain expertise for precise annotation, making it impractical in our opinion. Other researchers have attempted different strategies, such as (virtual) double staining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> or finding complementary biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> to facilitate distinction between tumor and non-tumor cells.</p>
