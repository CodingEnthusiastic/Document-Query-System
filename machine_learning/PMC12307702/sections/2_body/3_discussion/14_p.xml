A possible integration scenario can be for ML to flag the borderline cases, those near the G1/G2 threshold, for a more comprehensive manual review. This would help reduce the consequences of systemic bias and misclassification by image analysis tools. It can also output confidence scores, enabling pathologists to focus on low confidence predictions. This will involve further validation studies, including detailed analyses of comprehensive datasets of NET subtypes, outcome studies in patients with NETs, as well as the use of large external tumor datasets to validate the performance of the image analysis tool. Clinical validation, which involves correlating the calculated Ki67 score with clinical outcome data, is another important step to ensure the reliability and usefulness of the algorithm in real-world scenarios.</p>
