Instead, an approximative ground truth is usually established by a domain expert. In our study, we considered the manual counting of tumor cells by an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist to be a fair representation of the ground truth. The choice of using only one domain expert in setting the reference standard, i.e., not considering the expected inter-observer variability, could be regarded as an additional limitation. However, we believe this approach is reasonable considering the focus of the study, which is comparing the performance of two image analysis tools in detecting the correct tumor cells.</p>
