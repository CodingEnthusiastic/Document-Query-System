While numerous studies have already addressed the development and evaluation of related image analysis tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> many of these studies focused solely on the number of detected cells or the Ki67 score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, even if an image analysis tool returns the correct number of detected cells, the same as the reference standard, it does not guarantee that the correct cells have been identified (Supplementary Table S3 and S4 for detailed counts of tumor cells). The current study aims to evaluate detection results at the individual cell level to fully understand any performance differences. To achieve this, performance of a ML-based and a non-ML-based image analysis tool were evaluated in estimating Ki67 score in NETs. The employed non-ML analysis tool represents an example for the conventional approach with a user-friendly interface. While the chosen ML-based platform, supported by strong customer service, exemplifies the state-of-the-art technology and facilitates easy implementation for first-time users. By emphasizing the importance of correct tumor cell identification, our study provides a more comprehensive and clinically relevant evaluation of image analysis tools, ultimately enhancing their trustworthiness and interpretability.</p>
