Two main issues were observed in this regard. First, the method often struggled to accurately distinguish overlapping tumor cells, leading to an underestimation of the number of individual tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Secondly, ImageScope faces challenges in correctly segmenting Ki67 positive tumor cells in cases of inhomogeneous staining. This issue resulted in overestimation, where one cell was segmented as multiple objects (Supplementary Fig. S3). One approach to overcome the segmentation problem is to measure the area fraction, which compares the area of brown-stained nuclei to the total area of brown- and blue-stained nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, this solution can be sensitive to tumor type and cell size, making it less universally applicable. While efforts have been made to address this issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> a universally applicable solution has not yet emerged.</p>
