For those cells, labeling might be highly subjective due to stain quality, section thickness, nucleus appearance, as well as inter-observer and intra-observer variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The issue of non-tumor cell detection could be due to several underlying reasons, such as limited variation in the training dataset, and narrow control over the training procedures and other hyperparameters, which may limit the ability to fine-tune the model. Vesterinen et al.. reported a mildly better agreement between their trained Aiforia model and manual counting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. This could be due to having a bigger dataset. Another possible factor could be differences in the neural network settings. Additionally, they reported only the Ki67 score and did not provide details about their model&#8217;s performance in terms of cell counts.</p>
