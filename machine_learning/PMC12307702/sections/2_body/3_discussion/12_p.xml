The integration of automated image analysis tools in clinical practice can enable pathologists to evaluate larger portion of the biopsy in less time. In the current study, we compared two image analysis tools for cell detection and Ki67 score estimation in NETs with low proliferation index and highlighted the importance of evaluating performance at the individual cell level. In comparison with the chosen reference standard, the ML based image analysis demonstrated a better agreement in correctly detecting individual tumor cells, both Ki67 positive and negative, compared to the non-ML approach, resulting in improved Ki67 score calculation.</p>
