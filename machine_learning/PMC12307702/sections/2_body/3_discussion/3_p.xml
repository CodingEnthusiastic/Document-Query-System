However, the ML-based analysis with Aiforia exhibited better agreement with the reference standard in both cell detection and Ki67 score calculation compared to the non-ML-based analysis with ImageScope. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the improved concordance between the Aiforia&#8217;s Ki67 score, and the reference standard was attributed to its ability to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor cells.</p>
