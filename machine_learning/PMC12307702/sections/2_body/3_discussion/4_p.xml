However, the performance of Aiforia also showed limitations, manifested by its tendency to pick more positively Ki67-stained cells, including (i) faintly stained Ki67 positive tumor cells which were dismissed by the pathologist (SL), or (ii) Ki67 positively stained proliferating non-tumor cells, resulting in a slightly higher estimated score.</p>
