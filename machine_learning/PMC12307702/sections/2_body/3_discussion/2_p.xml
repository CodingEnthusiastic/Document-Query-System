Misclassifying these cases can have significant therapeutic implication. The WHO recommendation to count 500-2,000 cells is rather vague and does not consider the dependency on the proliferation rate. However, studies in breast cancer have clearly demonstrated that an accurate result depends on both the proliferation rate and the number of cells evaluated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Since manually counting such a large number of cells is impractical, an automated method that can assist in differentiating between G1 and G2 NETs can significantly improve workflow efficiency.</p>
