This variation has the potential to affect prediction results across different slides. While the current study takes into account the presence of stain variations when tuning algorithms, additional approaches specifically targeting this issue could involve the use of stain normalization techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>or virtual Ki67 staining methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. An even more effective strategy could be the application of virtual double Ki67/synaptophysin staining, which not only addresses staining variation, but also helps in identifying tumor cells, facilitating a better distinction between tumor and non-tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
