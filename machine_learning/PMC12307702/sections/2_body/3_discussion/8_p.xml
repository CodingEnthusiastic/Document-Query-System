Other similar studies have also developed ML models, either using proprietary software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> or open source software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Using proprietary software, like Aiforia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> offers certain advantages, such as fast and reliable customer support and often a more intuitive user interface. These factors make it easier, even for pathologists, to fine-tune an ML model. However, there are potential issues associated with proprietary closed source software, including cost, limited insight and control over individual settings and parameters, and ownership of the final trained model. Conducting similar analyses using open source software provides an alternative approach. In this case, more technical knowledge is required to implement and fine-tune the model, but it avoids the issues associated with proprietary software. The choice between proprietary software and open source software depends on various factors, including the specific requirements of the study, available resources, and the technical expertise of the researchers.</p>
