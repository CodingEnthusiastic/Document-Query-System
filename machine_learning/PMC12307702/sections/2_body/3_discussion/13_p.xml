Unfortunately, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluations and comparisons of image analysis tools, particularly in the rapidly expanding market of commercially available artificial intelligence software. The lack of such evaluations hampers the ability of pathology departments to make informed decisions when purchasing these tools. Additionally, existing publications often provide incomplete assessments of model performance, further highlighting the need for more rigorous and comprehensive evaluations.</p>
