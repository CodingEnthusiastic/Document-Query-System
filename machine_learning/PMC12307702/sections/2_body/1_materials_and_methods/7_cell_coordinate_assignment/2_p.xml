One possible explanation for this disparity is that the pathologist (SL) was not asked to mark the center of the tumor cell nuclei and occasionally placed the dot marking on the corner or edge of the tumor cell. The image analysis tools exhibited similar behavior, for technical reasons. To address the un-matching coordinates, we utilized the maximum diameter (based on visual examination) of a tumor cell as the maximum permitted distance between two sets of coordinates during comparison.</p>
