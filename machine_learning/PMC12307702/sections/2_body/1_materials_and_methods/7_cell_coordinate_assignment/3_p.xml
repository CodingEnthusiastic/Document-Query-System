For instance, when ImageScope detected several tumor cells in an area where the reference standard identified only one tumor cell, the Hungarian algorithm helped to determine the best matched detections. As a result of the assignment process, matched coordinates were considered true positive (TP) detections, unassigned coordinates from the reference standard were considered false negative (FN) detections, and unassigned coordinates from the respective image analysis tool were considered as false positive (FP) detections (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Furthermore, performance metrics including the false discovery rate (FDR), precision, recall, and F-score were utilized. By utilizing these metrics, in addition to comparing the number of tumor cells detected by the image analysis tools with the reference standard, we were able to evaluate whether each prediction was a correct tumor cell detection.</p>
