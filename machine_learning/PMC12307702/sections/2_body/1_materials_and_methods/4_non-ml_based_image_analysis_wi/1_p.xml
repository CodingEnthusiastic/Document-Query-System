This algorithm was chosen as it represents a conventional image analysis tool commonly used in research, with a user-friendly interface. Annotations and analyses were performed by the first author (MSc in biomedicine) under the supervision of an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist (SL). Several representative regions in the training/validation dataset were employed to adjust the input parameters to improve the detection and segmentation of tumor cells. The best parameter set (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), out of the evaluated configurations, was then applied to analyze the test dataset. Analysis produced mark-up images that classified and color-coded the detected cells on the basis of their staining intensity. Blue and red highlighting were used for negatively and positively Ki67-stained cells, respectively (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).</p>
