In particular, the mark-up images generated by ImageScope, which were utilized in ImageJ to manually obtain the coordinates of detected cells, had different resolutions compared to the original ROIs. To address these variations, a python script was developed to transform all the coordinates onto the same grid, by using the size and resolution of the ROIs and mark-up images.</p>
