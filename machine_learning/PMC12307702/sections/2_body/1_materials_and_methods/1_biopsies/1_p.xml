The cases consisted of both endoscopic biopsies and resection specimens. To enable a thorough comparison of the performance of the image analysis tools, a broad variety of NETs in terms of location, stromal content and inflammation were chosen. All cases were reported to have a low Ki67 score of less than 5% (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The original diagnostic slides (Superfrost plus glass) were used, with the biopsy sections having been cut at a thickness of 5 microns (&#181;m) and stained with Ki67 (Clone MIB-1, Dako, M7240) on the Roche Ventana Benchmark (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The glass slides were scanned with a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer XR (Hamamatsu Photonics Norden AB, Kista, Sweden) at 40x magnification, resulting in a resolution of 0.23&#160;&#956;m per pixel. Digital slides were accessed through Aperio eSlide Manager 12 (W10-7018) and viewed in Aperio ImageScope (v12.4.0.7018, Aperio ImageScope, Leica Biosystems, IL, US). All materials were acquired, and all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.</p>
