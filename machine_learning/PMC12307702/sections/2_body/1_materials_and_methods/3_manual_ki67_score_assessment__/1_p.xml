Manual annotation was conducted by an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist (SL) on Ki67-stained sections using the dot annotation feature of ImageJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> with the multi-point tool. The results of the annotation process included the number of marked cells on the image and the coordinates of these dot markings. The pathologist (SL) manually counted tumor cells within the ROIs twice, with a wash out period of six months between the counts. Illustrative examples and an instruction to dismiss faintly stained tumor cells were provided for the sake of consistency in the annotations. The intra-observer variability between the two counting rounds was found to be minimal (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The second count was considered the reference standard for all comparison with the image analysis tools (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).</p>
