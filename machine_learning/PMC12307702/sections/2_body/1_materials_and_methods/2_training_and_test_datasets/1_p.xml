For the training/validation dataset, the whole slide images (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;29) were uploaded to an ML platform, and different regions representing the normal histological variation of each case were used for training and validation. For testing, eight identically sized regions of interest (ROIs) were selected for each case (<italic>n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;10) by the first author (MSc in biomedicine) under the supervision of an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist (SL). Each test ROI marked a square region with an edge length of 200&#160;&#956;m in the area with the highest number of positively Ki67-stained tumor cells. Approximately 200 cells were contained within each test ROI. For the test dataset, only the ROIs were uploaded to the ML platform. Ki67 scores were calculated for each ROI by dividing the number of positive tumor cells by the number of tumor cells. The overall score for the given slide was determined by summing all the positive and tumor cell counts across the eight ROIs.</p>
