To compare the ML findings with GWAS results, we included SNPs not only identified in the training set in our study, but also all SNPs reported as genome-wide significant by larger meta-analyses (Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and applied the same gene annotation strategy as for the top variants from ML models (see <italic>&#8220;functional annotation and enrichment analysis&#8221;</italic>). In total, 130 genes were annotated, where more than one gene may be annotated to the same locus, and the same gene may be annotated to several independent loci. These genes correspond to 86 distinct loci reported in previous publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Of these, 19 loci were implicated by at least one ML methodology (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). <italic>APOE</italic> was found by all methods, seven loci (<italic>PICALM, IDUA, RASGEF1C, CLU, CR1, RTF2, RASA1</italic>) were found by GBMs and MB-MDRC 1&#8201;d, and two (<italic>ABCA7, BIN1</italic>) by MB-MDRC 1&#8201;d, GBMs and NNs. <italic>ABCA1</italic> was only detected by NNs, and two (<italic>SPPL2A</italic>, <italic>ADAMTS1</italic>) only by GBMs (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>
