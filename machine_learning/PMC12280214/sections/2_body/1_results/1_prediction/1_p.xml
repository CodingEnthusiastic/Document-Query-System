Prediction of AD status between models was highly correlated in the test set, having pairwise correlations between <italic>r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.80 and <italic>r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.87 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The highest correlations were observed for GBM-NN (<italic>r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.87) and GBM-MB-MDRC 1&#8201;d (<italic>r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.86). The weakest correlations were between NNs and PRS (<italic>r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.80). PRS was most strongly correlated with GBMs (<italic>r</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.84). For discrimination between cases and controls, the highest AUC of 0.692 (95% CI: 0.683-0.701) was obtained with gradient boosting, and was not significantly different to an AUC of 0.689 (0.679-0.698) for PRS (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The AUCs remained within the 95% CI when we excluded any imputed variants from the data, indicating no risk of bias from their inclusion (GBMs: 0.683, NN: 0.674, and MBMDRC-1d: 0.667 without imputed variants). Predictions remained stable across repeats with different random train-test splits (Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">4</xref>) and across the cohorts in the data (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). All models have a greater proportion of females in those predicted to be a case, reflecting the underling sex differences in the data (59% female, 62% female in cases, 57% in controls), except for GBMs which have a similar proportion in both cases and controls (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Methods overview.</title><p>Data was separated into an initial balanced random split before model selection (cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning) in the training split (<bold>a</bold>). All models were subsequently evaluated for association (annotation, enrichment analysis, interaction testing and replication; <bold>b</bold>) and prediction (AUC and correlations; <bold>c</bold>). Interaction tests report <italic>p-</italic>values from the Wald test in logistic regression (two-sided) as standard, after correction for multiple testing The full pipeline was run four times per model to assess robustness. For prediction, AUC values, statistical tests, and correlation analyses are based on the initial train-test split. For association, variants were prioritised if they appeared in the top SNP selection in at least two repeats.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2025_61650_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e5159"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Prediction from ML models in the test split for the most predictive models trained with the <italic>APOE</italic> region included.</title><p>The top two most predictive approaches (GBM, PRS) were not significantly different by AUC, as measured by DeLong&#8217;s test, though prediction from MB-MDRC 1&#8201;d was significantly below other methods (<bold>a</bold>). Bars show the AUC from a single test split for each model, where whiskers are 95% CIs from the pROC package. Unadjusted <italic>p</italic>-values from tests (ns: not significant, ****: <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0005) are annotated on panel a for DeLong&#8217;s two-sided test for correlated ROC curve; see supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> for exact values. Model predictions showed strong correlation, though correlation of the ranks is lower (<bold>b</bold>). Distributions of covariate-adjusted predictions for the most predictive approaches are similar but show a more distinct multimodal distribution for GBMs (<bold>c</bold>), NNs (<bold>d</bold>) and MB-MDRC 1d (<bold>f</bold>) compared to PRS (<bold>e</bold>), illustrating stronger influence of <italic>APOE</italic> risk alleles on predictions. Panel (<bold>g</bold>) shows the consistency across methods for individuals&#8217; prediction scores, where the participants in the 5% extreme tails of GBM predictions are followed across predictions from NN, PRS and MB-MDRC 1&#8201;d. Classifications metrics are given in (<bold>h</bold>). Model predictions broken down by covariates are shown in (<bold>i</bold>) and (<bold>j</bold>), where dark blue indicates predicted cases, and light blue predicted controls. Box plots in (<bold>j</bold>) show the median (center line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (box limits), and the whiskers which extend to 1.5 times the interquartile range.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2025_61650_Fig2_HTML" id="d33e5219"/></fig></p>
