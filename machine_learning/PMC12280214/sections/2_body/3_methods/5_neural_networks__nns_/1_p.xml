NN architectures were built with nine hidden layers, including an initial SNP-to-gene layer annotating all SNPs to the nearest gene using annotations from ANNOVAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, followed by layers defined from the hierarchy of terms from the Gene Ontology consortium (GO terms), where connections between layers progress from local pathways to more general ones as they move deeper through the network, using all available pathway annotations (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>).
