All study protocols were reviewed and approved by the respective institutional review boards overseeing the cohorts (see supplementary information for details). Individuals were genotyped at three centres. Data were accessed after quality control procedures and data harmonisation were applied to give the EADB-core sample. All participants are unrelated individuals of European ancestry, encompassing 20,013 clinically defined AD cases and 21,673 control, after excluding participants present in Kunkle et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. 59% of the sample is female, split as 62% in cases and 57% in controls, with a median age at baseline of 73 (IQR&#8201;=&#8201;14). Data and splitting procedures are described further in Supplementary section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1.1</xref>. Informed consent was obtained in writing from all study participants.
