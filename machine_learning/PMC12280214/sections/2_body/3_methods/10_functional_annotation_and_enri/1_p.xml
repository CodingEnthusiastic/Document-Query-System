SNPs were initially positionally mapped to genes using ANNOVAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> version 2020-06-07 and Gencode v40, and then reannotated using functional evidence from the Open Targets Genetics portal where available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Genome coordinates use build GRCh38.p14. Pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction from the consensus annotated genes were determined using STRING v12.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> (Supplementary section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1.7</xref>).</p>
