To give the same information to both PRS and all machine learning models, PRS were derived using summary statistics which were generated in the training set by running a genome-wide association study (GWAS), adjusting for the same confounders in PLINK v2.00a3.3LM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> (Supplementary section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1.5</xref>).</p>
