An approximation routine was used to accelerate permutation-based significance assessment and multiple testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, when searching for disease-susceptibility multi-locus genotypes, adjusted for confounders. Single and interacting variants under various pair-wise and higher order epistasis models were combined to create multi-locus risk scores (MB-MDRC) and estimate an individual&#8217;s susceptibility to a trait with the MBMDRClassifieR package available in R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. SNPs and SNP-SNP interactions were included in the MB-MDR risk score if they passed the permutation-based multiple testing corrected threshold that had the best performance in the train split (Supplementary section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1.4</xref>).</p>
