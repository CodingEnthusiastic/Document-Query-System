To avoid excluding key known AD loci not covered in the genotyped data, we also included 67 imputed variants in previously reported genome-wide significant loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) which were not already present in the genotyped data, converting the imputed dosages to the most probable (probability &#8805; 0.9) genotypes, and applying further quality control as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Data were further filtered for a minor allele frequency of 5%, to ensure variants were common enough to reliably observe interactions. SNPs were clumped (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#8201;=&#8201;0.75 following Joiret et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, window = 1&#8201;Mb) using stage 1 summary statistics from Kunkle et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, after removing individuals common between the summary statistics and the genotyped data. Out of 81 SNPs previously reported as genome-wide significant, 52 survived minor allele frequency (MAF) and clumping procedures (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>; Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>), giving a combined 215,193 SNPs (Supplementary section&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1.1</xref>). Analyses were also run without inclusion of the previously reported 67 imputed variants to confirm that their inclusion did not artificially inflate performance estimates.</p>
