Wu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> demonstrated that Ly6h is among the proteins competing to bind to &#945;7 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are expressed throughout the brain and enable fast cholinergic transmission at synapses. These proteins function collectively to maintain the optimal &#945;7 assembly required for neuronal function and viability. This delicate balance is disrupted during Alzheimer&#8217;s disease due to A&#946;-driven reduction in Ly6h. Notably, an increase in Ly6h in human cerebrospinal fluid correlates with elevated Alzheimer&#8217;s disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
