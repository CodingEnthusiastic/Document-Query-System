Gradient boosting, neural networks, and multifactor dimensionality reduction were selected due to their prominence in the field, demonstrated performance, and complementary strengths. These methods offer distinct advantages: highly performant tree ensembles (GBMs), flexible networks incorporating prior knowledge (NNs), and detection of SNP-SNP interactions (MB-MDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Here they were applied to identify novel genes not detectable via GWAS, and to compare ML prediction accuracies with PRS.</p>
