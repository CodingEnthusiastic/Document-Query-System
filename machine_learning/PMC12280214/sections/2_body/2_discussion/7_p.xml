The method is an improvement over classical pair-wise statistical interaction approaches as it can detect more complex interactions. However, it implements a somewhat conservative strategy for variant discovery, as interaction studies are hampered by several factors that can increase the number of false positives including, but not limited to, LD and interference of major loci, which may contribute to phantom epistasis. To address this limitation, we opted for a model-based (MB) form of MDR, though the results did not highlight novel loci.</p>
