The <italic>AP4E1</italic> gene encodes the &#949; subunit of adaptor protein complex-4 (AP-4), which facilitates the transport of amyloid precursor protein (APP) from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes. Disruption of the APP-AP-4 interaction enhances &#947;-secretase-catalysed cleavage of APP to amyloid-&#946; peptide, suggesting that AP-4 deficiency may constitute a potential risk factor for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
