Neural networks also highlight a new potential AD-relevant locus. All GO-derived pathways, independent of association to AD, were used in the neural network analysis as hidden layers. This approach highlighted SNPs mapping to <italic>SOD1</italic> (cytogenic band 21q22.11), found in the region of <italic>APP</italic> (21q21.3), with lead SNPs from NNs around 5&#8201;Mb away from the closest NN-based hits in <italic>APP</italic>. <italic>SOD1</italic> has been widely investigated for its role in antioxidant defense system, showing impaired expression in AD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, but is currently primarily implicated in ALS.</p>
