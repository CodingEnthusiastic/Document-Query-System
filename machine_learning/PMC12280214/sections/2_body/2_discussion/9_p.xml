Such SNPs may nonetheless represent important loci which impact disease risk in specific contexts without being consistently associated across enough studies and circumstances to reach genome-wide significance under linear models in meta-analyses. While machine learning models here do not show signs of overfitting, and top SNP rankings by SHAP values are consistent in both the train and test splits, many SNPs identified do not replicate in an external dataset, which is also the case for standard GWAS. In particular, in PRS approaches using different priors (for Bayesian models) or LD pruning parameters (in clumping and thresholding approaches), the resulting set of SNPs and their estimated effects will differ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Similarly, when effects of SNPs are jointly estimated in sparse, high-dimensional ML models, either simultaneously or in a stage-wise manner (as in gradient boosting), different top associations and predictions are expected. Despite these caveats, we show that the novel findings suggest SNPs which are biologically relevant to AD.</p>
