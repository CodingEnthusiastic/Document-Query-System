Disruptions in Golgi function have been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Mutations in COG7 are associated with Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, which frequently manifest with neurological impairments. Abnormal glycosylation processes have been implicated in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease pathology, particularly affecting tau protein processing and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
