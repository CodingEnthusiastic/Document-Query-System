Though replication challenges remain, ML successfully prioritised established risk loci and identified biologically relevant novel associations, including variants in <italic>ARHGAP25</italic>, <italic>COG7</italic>, <italic>LY6H</italic>, and <italic>SOD1</italic>. These findings highlight ML&#8217;s potential to refine our understanding of AD beyond additive genetic effects and expand the toolkit available for maximising discovery from available data. With expanding datasets and computational advances, ML could further enhance risk prediction and gene discovery, particularly through federated learning and multi-omic integration. This study marks a key step toward leveraging ML for deeper insights into AD genetics.</p>
