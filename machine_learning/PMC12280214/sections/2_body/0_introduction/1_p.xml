<p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par4">Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled huge progress in identifying variants associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on these variants have greatly improved prediction of disease status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, inherent to GWAS and PRS are the assumptions that variants are independent predictors, linearly associated with the outcome, and therefore combine additively within and between loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, with no interactions occurring between variants, or between genes and other risk factors. While such simplifying genetic assumptions have proved fruitful across a range of diseases and disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, they are at odds with biological evidence in AD that disease heterogeneity and responses from cells such as microglia are dependent on <italic>APOE</italic> status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Further, there is genetic evidence suggesting that different variants are associated with the disease depending on <italic>APOE</italic> status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and age at diagnosis or assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. As GWAS sample size increases and PRS approach limits on predictive performance, alternative modelling approaches are essential to maximise discoveries from existing data and enable a deeper understanding of AD genetics.</p>
