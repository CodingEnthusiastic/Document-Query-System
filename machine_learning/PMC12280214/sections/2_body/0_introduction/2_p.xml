Several studies have applied ML to the genetics of brain disorders and have been recently summarised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Previous ML attempts have been impacted by high risk of bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and population stratification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, while AD studies in particular have been hampered by low sample size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, leaving a gap for comprehensive, large-scale studies that rigorously apply ML to genome-wide data. We conducted the largest genome-wide ML study in AD to date, marking a pivotal moment in the field. Our study presents a reproducible, bias-aware approach for ML model development, validation, and confounder adjustment. We trained three of the most prominent approaches in the field to compare predictive accuracy and uncover novel AD-associated risk loci which were not identified by traditional GWAS.</p>
