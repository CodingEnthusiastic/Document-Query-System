<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field encompassing the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning (DL) is a subfield of ML algorithms and techniques, which immediately entered the field of clinical research [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With ML, computers can be trained to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed, allowing them to improve their performance over time through experience. ML is a computational procedure through which a system is capable of identifying and understanding the input data and, consequently, using the obtained information in decision&#8208;making and prediction of different events [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The application of these methods has led to extraordinary results in medical data processing, and they have been remarkably successful in diagnosing various diseases [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A major application of ML concerning health is the diagnosis or prognosis of different diseases. Diagnostic or prognostic models can be utilized as a system to support clinical decisions to help clinicians [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, they may be used as a model to predict mortality in various diseases [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
