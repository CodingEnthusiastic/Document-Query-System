ML literature can be utilized to investigate large repositories of health&#8208;related data for this disease [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which can contribute to the recognition of unknown factors with clinical phenotypes of diabetes, causative pathways, patterns, and their interactions [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many primary and secondary studies on the application of ML show that it is mainly used for the risk factors classification of glycemic control, the prediction and diagnosis of genetic and environmental factors, health care, and diabetes disease management [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
