<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Bibliometrics is described as mathematical techniques utilized to evaluate the quality and quantity of the existing scientific literature. They are used to investigate trends of research, citation analysis, authorship, journal impact, and analysis along with international collaboration in many scientific fields [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. According to the existing knowledge, no bibliometric research has been published in the scientific literature to date in the field of ML in diabetes. Given the high prevalence of this disease and the increasing trend of utilizing these models, numerous studies are inclined to employ AI models. Therefore, Analysis and mapping of ML in the context of diabetes using bibliometric indicators can give us a deep understanding of the present literature in this field and reveal future directions. Thus, this study aims to analysis and mapping of ML in the context of diabetes.</p>
