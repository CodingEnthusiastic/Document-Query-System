<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ML has started to change some important aspects of health care, such as diagnosis and screening of diseases. A bibliometric study was done to analyze the global condition and trends of research in the field of ML and diabetes, which allows readers to achieve a sound understanding of the literature on this field. The study highlights the importance of considering risk factors and prevalence in developing ML prediction models, and emphasizes the need for expert validation of these models. Funding should target international collaborations using ML to improve diabetes care in lower&#8208;income nations. The findings offer guidance for early&#8208;career researchers in this field.</p>
