A total of 10,239 keywords were identified in 5,222 articles. The keywords that appeared at least 10 times in the collected literature are categorized into eight clusters. The largest cluster is marked in red, in which the keywords machine learning, risk factors, Covid&#8208;19, prediction model, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes mellitus had the highest correlation with each other. The second cluster is marked in green, classification, support vector machine, system, and artificial neural network keywords had the highest correlation in this cluster. The third cluster is highlighted in blue in Figure&#160;<xref rid="hsr271167-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. In this cluster, diabetic retinopathy, deep learning, artificial intelligence, glucose, automated detection, and optical coherence tomography had the highest correlation with each other. The furth cluster is displayed in yellow. In this cluster, deep learning, diabetes, diagnosis, and validation, had the highest correlation.</p>
