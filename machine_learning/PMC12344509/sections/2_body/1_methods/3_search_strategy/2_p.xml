<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To build our data set, we searched from WoS in June 2024. Related keywords were used to set the search strategy. These keywords were selected based on primary studies, relevant systematic reviews, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). In addition, the key terms were reviewed and finalized by a panel of subject experts who were experienced in ML and diabetes studies. The search strategy was TS&#8201;=&#8201;(&#8220;Machine Learning&#8221; OR &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221; OR &#8220;Deep Learning&#8221; OR &#8220;Support Vector Machine*&#8221; OR &#8220;Decision Tree*&#8221; OR &#8220;Neural Network*&#8221; OR &#8220;Random Forest*&#8221;) AND TS&#8201;=&#8201;(Diabete* OR &#8220;Diabetes Mellitus&#8221; OR Noninsulin&#8208;Dependent OR &#8220;Noninsulin Dependent&#8221; OR Non&#8208;Insulin&#8208;Dependent OR &#8220;Noninsulin Dependent&#8221; OR &#8220;Insulin Dependent&#8221; OR &#8220;Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus&#8221; OR &#8220;Type 2 Diabetes&#8221; OR &#8220;Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus&#8221; OR &#8220;Type 1 Diabetes&#8221; OR &#8220;Pregnancy&#8208;Induced Diabetes&#8221; OR &#8220;Gestational Diabetes&#8221; OR &#8220;Gestational Diabetes Mellitus&#8221;). We did not restrict the search by language. We limited our search to original articles, reviews, and proceedings, and excluded news, letters to editorials, abstracts of meetings, editorial materials, retraction, and retracted studies. We restricted our search to 2010&#8208;01&#8208;01 till 2023&#8208;12&#8208;31. Since ML models are new and because the new AI revolution started after 2010, the period from 2010 to 2023 has been considered in this paper.</p>
