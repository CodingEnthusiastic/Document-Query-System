Microsoft Excel 2013 was employed for drawing trends of results. We calculated the number of times countries and authors were mentioned in the data set to detect the most prolific of them. The VOSviewer software (Version 1.6.20, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) was applied as a network analysis tool to show international research collaboration, author collaboration, and research domains. Keywords and authors with similar meanings but different spellings or expressions were merged. We created and utilized keywords and authors' thesauruses to ensure consistency and obtain accurate outputs from the VOSviewer. The papers included were sorted in descending order based on the citation frequency; we used the &#8220;sort by citations: highest first&#8221; option to arrange the highest to lowest cited papers. We selected the first ten most cited papers.</p>
