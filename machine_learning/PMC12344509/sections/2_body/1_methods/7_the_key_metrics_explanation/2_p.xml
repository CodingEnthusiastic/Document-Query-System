The node size is a reflection of the number of studies published by different countries, institutions, or authors. A link is a connection or a relation between two nodes. The links between nodes represent collaboration relationships, and the distance of the links between nodes signifies the strength of the cooperative relationships. Each link has a strength, represented by a positive numerical value. The higher this value, the stronger the link. the Links and Total link strength attributes indicate, respectively, the number of links of an item with other items and the total strength of the links of an item with other items. The node color denotes the clusters of countries in the same group. A cluster is a set of items included in a map. The color of the lines represents the time of the first cooperation between the two countries, institutions, or authors. The thickness of the lines is positively correlated to collaboration between the countries, institutions, or authors. In the co&#8208;occurrence network map, the nodes signify different categories and keywords. The node size in co&#8208;occurring research categories network denotes the number of studies in each category, and the node size in co&#8208;occurring keywords network represents the frequency of occurrence. The links are representative of co&#8208;occurrence relationships. The color of lines represents the time of the first co&#8208;occurring between the two categories or keywords. The thickness of the lines is positively related to the number of studies with the same label between the categories, or positively correlated to the frequency of keywords occurring together [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
