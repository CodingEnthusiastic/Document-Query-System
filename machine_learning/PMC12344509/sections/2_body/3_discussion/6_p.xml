Author collaboration analysis has allowed us to identify authors who collaborated in the clusters with color distinction. These clusters also provided the possibility to identify collaborative groups. The results show that Tien Yin Wong, Sobha Sivaprasad, and Ramachandran Rajalakshmi had the highest scientific cooperation with each other and with other researchers. These three researchers are leaders in this field, and following their works can determine the direction of future research in ML and diabetes, which will be useful as a guide, especially for early career researchers.</p>
