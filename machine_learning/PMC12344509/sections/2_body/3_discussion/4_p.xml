The possible reason might be that academic papers on international collaboration enjoy a greater scientific impact than their national counterparts [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This can increase the motivation of researchers in their inclination for international cooperation. Other factors can be internationalized universities and strong English language skills in the USA that facilitate the formation of scientific cooperation networks. Emerging economies, such as India and Saudi Arabia, are leveraging international collaborations to harness ML capabilities in addressing the challenges of diabetes [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Collaborations between developed and developing nations, leveraging local expertise alongside advanced research methods, offer a model for other developing countries' research endeavors.</p>
