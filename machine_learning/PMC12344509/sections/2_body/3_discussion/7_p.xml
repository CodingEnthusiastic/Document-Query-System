<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In scientometrics studies, co&#8208;occurrence analysis of keywords is common to identify the research topic in a specific field and over a specific period. The correlation between the words &#8220;machine learning, prediction model, risk factors, type 2 diabetes, association, and prevalence&#8221; shows that to create or adapt a prediction model in the field of diabetes, researchers need to identify the risk factors of this disease. They also should pay attention to the prevalence of the outcome in this data set. Correlation between words in another category (diabetic retinopathy, deep learning, artificial intelligence, convolutional neural network (CNN), automated detection, validation, optical coherence tomography (OCT)) also shows that if there is a data set that includes OCT images of patients with diabetic retinopathy, DL models can be created using CNN to help physicians and diabetes specialists make decisions in screening or diagnosing this disease, and the previous study confirm the findings of this paper [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The analysis shows a strong correlation between several keywords. This suggests that researchers need to consider not only risk factors and prevalence but also the type of risk factors when creating or adapting prediction models. This implies that the prevalence of the outcome variable within the data set is a crucial factor in the research methodology.</p>
