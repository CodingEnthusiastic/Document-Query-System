<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To our knowledge, this study is among the first to conduct a bibliometric analysis on ML applications in diabetes care, Nevertheless, the current study has some limitations. Specifically, the analyzed articles were only retrieved from WoS. However, future researchers could consider alternative sources of data collection, such as Scopus or Google Scholar. The results of this paper can help early career who intend to enter the field of ML and diabetes create a practical and comprehensive ML model. Exclusion of other major databases such as Scopus or Google Scholar could influence the findings. Highly cited articles from earlier years may have a disproportionate impact on the analysis. Publications in English dominate the data set. Also, the most cited papers in this field show that the most important feature of these papers is the high generalizability of their ML models and the evaluation of their models by subject experts in the field of diabetes. Therefore, the researchers of this paper recommend that for future studies, in addition to the external and internal evaluation of these models, assessment by the subject experts in diabetes should also be considered as a complementary method in conducting studies.</p>
