<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In this study, also the most prolific countries were identified. According to the results, USA has been at the forefront of ML research themes and diabetes, and the previous studies confirm the findings of this paper [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several reasons can be presented for this finding. The presence of technology giants such as Google and Microsoft in this country can be a basis for the tendency or desire to publish more in this field. On the other hand, the migration of elites to the USA and their interest in studying in this country can be another justification for this result, leading to more scientific publications [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The bibliometric study recently published identified China as one of the leading country in conducting studies in this area [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. There are several reasons for this. One of the reasons is that almost half of the population of the world lives in China, it can be stated that the prevalence of diabetes and its complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, is higher in this country. On the other hand, China is among the semi&#8208;developed ones, which have sufficient technical infrastructure to conduct ML studies, so it can be a motive for the researchers of these countries to use these models.</p>
