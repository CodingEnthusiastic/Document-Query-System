This study is among the first to conduct a bibliometric analysis on ML applications in diabetes care, including 5,222 articles adopted from WoS. The findings of this bibliometric analysis show a rich overview of the growth of scientific literature on ML in the context of diabetes over the past fourteen years, especially in 2018. This can be due to the high prevalence of diabetes worldwide and the application of ML to diagnose and treat diabetes in recent years. It can be predicted that the publication of papers will continue to flourish in the forthcoming years. Other bibliometric studies also confirm this finding [<xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="hsr271167-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
