<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Despite these advances, critical gaps remain. Most current ML tools excel at a single length or time scale, yet polymers exhibit phenomena&#8212;from chain entanglement and phase separation to fracture and creep&#8212;that span orders of magnitude. Few SciML methods rigorously quantify prediction confidence, limiting their reliability for safety-critical or regulatory applications. Polymer data are often sparse, proprietary, or measured under inconsistent protocols, making generalization challenging. While PINNs have shown promise, they remain computationally demanding for large-scale polymer process simulations and have yet to fully incorporate complex rheological laws or multicomponent interactions. The articles in this Special Issue directly address these gaps. The multi-objective optimization of NN hyperparameters for composites and membranes (Malashin et al. [<xref rid="B7-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) demonstrates how tailored ML can capture multiple target properties simultaneously, offering a template for multi-scale model coupling. Three-dimensional autoencoder defect detection (Liu et al. [<xref rid="B8-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]) and hysteresis modeling of magnetorheological elastomers (Alawi et al. [<xref rid="B9-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) illustrate how ML can embed physics constraints into high-dimension inverse problems, paving the way for more efficient, physics-driven simulators. Diffusion coefficient prediction in Nafion membranes and QSPR-based cleansing foam design showcase strategies for data-synthesis and transfer learning to mitigate data scarcity by combining experiments, surrogate models, and generative screening (Malashin et al. [<xref rid="B10-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]).</p>
