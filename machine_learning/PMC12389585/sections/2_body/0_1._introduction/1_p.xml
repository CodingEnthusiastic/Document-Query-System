<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Polymeric materials are ubiquitous in modern technology, from structural composites and membranes to responsive elastomers, yet their design remains challenging due to complex, multi-scale behaviors. Conventional modeling often struggles to capture phenomena spanning the molecular to the macroscopic scale in polymers. In recent years, Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), the integration of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) with physical models, has emerged as a powerful approach to accelerate polymer research and development. By incorporating domain knowledge (such as physical laws or material science heuristics) into neural networks, SciML methods can leverage limited experimental or simulation data to build more accurate, interpretable models than black-box ML alone.</p>
