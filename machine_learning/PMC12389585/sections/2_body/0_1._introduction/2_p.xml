<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the past five years, the emergence of SciML has transformed polymer research by combining data-driven algorithms with physical models to overcome the limitations of purely empirical or purely first-principles approaches. Graph- and sequence-based neural networks have enabled rapid screening of polymer chemistries, surrogate models and active-learning frameworks have accelerated high-throughput material discovery, and physics-informed architectures (e.g., PINNs) have begun to bridge molecular-scale dynamics with macroscopic behavior without requiring massive datasets. ML models now predict complex structure&#8211;property relationships, enabling the inverse design and high-throughput screening of polymer candidates (Xie et al. [<xref rid="B1-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], Pai et al. [<xref rid="B2-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). SciML techniques now combine physics-based models with data-driven ML to enhance accuracy and interpretability, even with limited data (Audus et al. [<xref rid="B3-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Nanjo et al. [<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). ML techniques such as random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines are increasingly used to predict the thermal, mechanical, and optical properties of polymers and composites (Malashin et al. [<xref rid="B5-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], Hamidi et al. [<xref rid="B6-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]).</p>
