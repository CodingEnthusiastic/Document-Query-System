<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Together, the works in this Special Issue advance polymer science by leveraging data, descriptors, and physics in novel ways. They showcase how SciML methods not only improve predictive accuracy but also offer insight into why materials behave as they do, often reducing development cycles. Looking forward, further progress will likely come from more tightly integrating physics-based knowledge with ML (as in PINNs and hybrid models), expanding open polymer datasets for training, and improving interpretability and uncertainty quantification. As noted in the Special Issue&#8217;s call for papers, the overarching goal is to use scientific AI to unravel multi-scale polymer phenomena and accelerate innovation in polymeric materials. The contributions collected here have taken important steps toward achieving that goal: they provide new models, algorithms, and frameworks that deepen our understanding and capability in polymer design. We anticipate that these advances will inform ongoing research, inspire new SciML applications in polymer science, and help to realize the Special Issue&#8217;s vision of smart, data-driven polymer innovation.</p>
