The featured studies show that integrating AI methods, ranging from neural networks and evolutionary optimization to physics-informed frameworks and ensemble learners, can greatly enhance our ability to predict, understand, and design polymeric materials. For example, the data-driven optimization of neural network models has yielded accurate predictions of composite properties, while novel 3D autoencoders have improved nondestructive defect detection in composites. Machine learning applied to polymer membranes, polymer property databases, and complex mixtures (like cleansing foams) has revealed subtle structure&#8211;property relationships and identified optimal formulations without exhaustive experimentation. The hysteresis modeling of magnetorheological elastomers illustrates how SciML can be used to capture nonlinear smart material behaviors, enabling precise device design. Complementing these technical advances, the three review articles synthesize the state of the art in the field and point toward future opportunities: they highlight, for instance, how physics-informed learning can bridge scales in polymer simulation and how boosting algorithms are reshaping data-driven polymer design.</p>
