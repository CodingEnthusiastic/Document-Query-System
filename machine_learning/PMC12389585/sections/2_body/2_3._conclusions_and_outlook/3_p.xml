<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Future research should build on these foundations by developing hybrid multi-scale frameworks that seamlessly couple molecular simulations (MD/DFT) with continuum-scale ML models to predict processing&#8211;structure&#8211;property maps; embedding robust uncertainty quantification (e.g., Bayesian PINNs, ensemble learning) to deliver prediction intervals alongside point estimates, critical for design under uncertainty and regulatory approval; creating shared, standardized polymer data repositories and benchmarks that enable fair comparison, reproducibility, and meta-learning across different polymer classes and experimental conditions; optimizing physics&#8211;ML co-solvers for large-scale manufacturing simulations, leveraging reduced-order modeling, operator learning, and adaptive sampling to enable real-time digital twins of polymer processes; and expanding reinforcement-learning and generative models for closed-loop, autonomous material discovery, where AI not only predicts properties but also actively proposes and synthesizes novel polymer chemistries in laboratory workflows.</p>
