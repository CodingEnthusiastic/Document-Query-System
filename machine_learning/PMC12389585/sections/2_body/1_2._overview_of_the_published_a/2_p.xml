<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Recent research has showcased how ML and AI are revolutionizing polymer science&#8212;from materials design and property prediction to novel testing methods. For example, Brighel et al. [<xref rid="B11-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] demonstrated that an AI-trained model can make analytical crystallization elution fractionation (aCEF) a standalone characterization tool: their model automatically classifies commercial polyolefins without any prior chemical information.</p>
