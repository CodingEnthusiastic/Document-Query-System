<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Complementing these research highlights are three extensive review papers. Long et al. [<xref rid="B13-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] provide an overarching perspective on AI in polymers, advocating a shift from traditional experimentation to data-driven design. They document AI&#8217;s transformative impact on polymer design, property prediction, and processing and outline strategies (e.g., collaborative data platforms, explainable models) for overcoming challenges like data scarcity. Malashin and colleagues contribute two focused reviews: one on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [<xref rid="B14-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in polymers and another on SVMs [<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-02222" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The PINN review summarizes recent advances in embedding physical laws into neural networks for multi-scale polymer modeling, while the SVM review surveys how kernel-based ML methods have been used to predict polymer properties, optimize synthesis, and control processes. Together, these reviews highlight the rapid integration of ML techniques, ranging from SVMs to deep PINNs, into polymer science, and they chart future directions for AI-enabled polymer innovation.</p>
