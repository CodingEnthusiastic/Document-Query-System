Chi-squared tests were used for categorical variables and an independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables. A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed between the exposure and control cohorts for the following variables that were considered to potentially influence the outcomes studied: age, sex (male / female), race (White, Black, Asian, unknown), Hispanic ethnicity, medical history (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation / flutter, overweight and obesity, chronic kidney disease, chronic lower respiratory diseases, tobacco use, ischemic stroke, non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and other venous embolism and thrombosis) and medications (aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran). Age was considered as a continuous variable and all other above variables were included as categorical variables for propensity score matching. The TriNetX platform uses nearest-neighbor matching with a tolerance level of 0.01 and a difference between propensity scores&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.1.</p>
