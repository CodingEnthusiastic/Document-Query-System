First, patients who received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer vaccine cohort) were compared to the control cohort, as were patients who received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination (Moderna vaccine cohort). These two vaccination subgroups were chosen for analysis as they accounted for the majority of patients in the exposure cohort (69% and 28%, respectively). Second, the original analyses were divided temporally into two parts based on the dominant COVID-19 variant: patients admitted with AIS between April 1, 2021 to November 30, 2021 (Part 1) when the Delta variant was dominant and patients admitted with AIS between December 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 (Part 2) when the Omicron variant was dominant (Supplementary Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In all subgroup analyses, propensity-score matching and Cox proportional hazard analyses were conducted between the exposure (vaccinated) and control (unvaccinated) cohorts to generate HR and 95% CI as outlined above.</p>
