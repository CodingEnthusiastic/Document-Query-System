The matched cohorts were compared by Cox proportional hazard analysis for secondary outcomes and reported with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for comparison of time-to-event rates. To assess the risk of secondary outcomes (intracranial hemorrhage, acute myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, mechanical ventilation, and G-tube placement), patients with prior history of the same diagnosis or procedure when admitted for index AIS were excluded to ensure only true occurrences, and not follow-up for prior occurrences, were analyzed.</p>
