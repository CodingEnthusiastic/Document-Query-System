We utilized the COVID-19 Research Network in TriNetX, which contains EHR data for over 121 million unique patients in 88 healthcare organizations from ten countries. TriNetX only uses aggregated counts and statistical summaries of de-identified information, so protected health information and personal data are not made available to users of the platform. Therefore, Institutional Review Board approval was not required for this study. The codes for demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and medication prescriptions used in this study are available in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.</p>
