Patients in the vaccinated cohort had received two doses of Pfizer (BNT162b2), two doses of Moderna (mRNA-127), two doses of Astrazeneca (ChAdOx1) or one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson (Ad26.COV2.S) COVID-19 vaccine at least two months before the diagnosis of AIS (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The unvaccinated group included patients who did not receive any of the above four COVID-19 vaccines based on documentation in their EHRs. Patients in these cohorts were identified for analysis on May 9, 2023. At the time of the search, 85 health care organizations that met the study criteria were included in the study. All patients in the vaccinated cohort were from the United States. In the unvaccinated cohort, 95% of patients were from the United States and 5% were from other countries. TriNetX only reports the percentage of patients from the United States versus other countries without specifying which other countries are represented in the cohorts. Among all AIS admissions between April 1, 2021 and September 20, 2022 in the database, 39% had a documented COVID-19 infection in the 30 days prior to admission.</p>
