It is well known that severe COVID-19 can trigger hypercoagulability and vascular damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, so perhaps vaccination prevents progression to the point of such severe physiologic derangements and consequently reduces the risk of these cerebrovascular and cardiovascular insults.
