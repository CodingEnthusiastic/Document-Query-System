Vaccination against COVID-19 should be encouraged, particularly in the population of patients who are at higher risk of having a stroke. Even if vaccination against COVID-19 does not eliminate the risk of infection, the findings here demonstrate that vaccination is associated with a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality in the event of COVID-19-associated AIS.</p>
