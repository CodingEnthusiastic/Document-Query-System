A meta-analysis reported that the prevalence of AIS after COVID-19 vaccination is comparable to that in the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In our study, patients in the vaccination exposure cohort had completed full course of COVID-19 primary vaccination at least two months before AIS. Hence, AIS is unlikely to have been due to COVID-19 vaccination.</p>
