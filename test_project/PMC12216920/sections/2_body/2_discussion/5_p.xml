In this study, 78% (n&#8201;=&#8201;45/58) of patients received a complete vaccination course (two doses)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Among these, 36/45 patients developed neurological symptoms of AIS within 60 days of completing vaccination. There was no difference in mortality in previously vaccinated cases with AIS (13.8%) compared to unvaccinated AIS cases (8.6%, <italic>p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.23). In the current study, the effect of vaccine-related AIS was eliminated by including only patients who experienced AIS more than 60 days (2 months) after completing the full vaccination course. In this case, AIS cases with breakthrough COVID-19 infection and previous vaccination display lower mortality and morbidity compared to unvaccinated AIS cases.</p>
