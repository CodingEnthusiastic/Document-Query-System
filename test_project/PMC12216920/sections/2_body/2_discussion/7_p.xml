As the patient EHR data available for analysis do not represent a random sample of all COVID-19-associated AIS cases, the results may not be generalizable to all patients who present with this combination of diagnoses. Although all patients in the vaccinated cohort and 95% of unvaccinated cohort were from the United States, about 5% of unvaccinated cohort were from other countries, the details of which are not known and this could potentially bias our study results. TriNetX does not provide information about cause of death, stroke severity, and etiology, limiting the interpretations that can be drawn as to why the association between COVID-19 vaccination and reduced morbidity and mortality in this patient population exists. Similarly, as this is a retrospective observational study, conclusions about a direction of causality in the relationship cannot be made, considering that unmeasured or uncontrolled confounders that were not or could not be matched for between the two cohorts may explain it.</p>
