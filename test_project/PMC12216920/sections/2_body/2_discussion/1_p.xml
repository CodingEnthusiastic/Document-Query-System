It is unclear whether the reduced risk of mortality in the vaccinated cohort is due to reduced severity of AIS in this cohort or the fact that vaccinated patients were less likely to die from COVID-19 infection itself, or the combination of both effects. Our findings that vaccinated patients had better AIS-specific outcomes, suggest that severity of AIS may partially account for the reduced risk of overall mortality in the vaccinated cohort.</p>
