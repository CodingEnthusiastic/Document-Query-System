Vaccinated patients experienced significantly reduced rates of venous thromboembolism and acute myocardial infarction during the periods of Delta and Omicron COVID-19 variant dominance. However, significant reduction in the risk of intracranial hemorrhage was only observed in the Delta variant dominant sub-analysis. Therefore, COVID-19 viral variant may function as a minor effect modifier with respect to the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and morbidity in COVID-19-associated AIS cases.</p>
