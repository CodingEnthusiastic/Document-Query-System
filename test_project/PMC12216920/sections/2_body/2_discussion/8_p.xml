Given the sample size and observed effect sizes, the estimated power to detect differences across key outcomes was low. Therefore, the lack of statistically significant findings in the Moderna subgroup may reflect limited power rather than a true absence of effect, and these results should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, survivorship bias could have skewed the results as perhaps survivors in the unvaccinated cohort who survived were healthier than their counterparts in the vaccinated cohort, who were aided in surviving by the vaccination series. Cases who were fully vaccinated at least two months before the diagnosis of AIS were included in the exposure cohort, but besides that the time between vaccination and AIS was not accounted for. Therefore, the effect of recent versus remote vaccination on the outcomes of interest was not measured. Additionally, the analysis did not distinguish between those cases experiencing first versus recurrent COVID-19 infection, which could have also been a confounder in elucidating the relationship between infection, AIS, and the outcomes of interest.</p>
