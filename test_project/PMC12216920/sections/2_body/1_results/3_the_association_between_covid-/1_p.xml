Compared to the unvaccinated cohort, patients who received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine had lower rates of all-cause mortality, although this was only significant at the 7 day timepoint [7 days: 3.1% vs 4.4%; HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.71; 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.53&#8211;0.95 and 30 days: 7.8% vs 8.8%; HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.85; 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.70&#8211;1.03)] (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The Pfizer COVID-19 cohort also experienced reduced rates of intracranial hemorrhage [7 days: 3.9% vs 6.1%; HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.62; 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.48&#8211;0.81 and 30 days: 4.3% vs 6.6%; HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.65; 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.50&#8211;0.84)], venous thromboembolism [7 days: 3.0% vs 7.4%; HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.40; 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.29&#8211;0.54 and 30 days: 4.1% vs 8.8%; HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.45; 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.35&#8211;0.59], and acute myocardial infarction [7 days: 3.3% vs 7.2%; HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.45; 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.34&#8211;0.60 and 30 days: 3.7% vs 7.9%; HR&#8201;=&#8201;0.46; 95% CI&#8201;=&#8201;0.35&#8211;0.61] at 7 and 30 days after hospitalization (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). They also displayed lower rates of mechanical ventilation at 7 days but not at 30 days after hospitalization. There was no significant difference in G-tube placement between the two cohorts (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>
