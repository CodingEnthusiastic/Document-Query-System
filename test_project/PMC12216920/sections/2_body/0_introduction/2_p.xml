These vaccinations prevent severe COVID-19 infection and reduce the rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and emergency department visits during infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. COVID-19 vaccination is also associated with reduced risk of AIS after COVID-19 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, as well as lower stroke severity at hospital discharge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and at follow-up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, existing literature has not explored morbidity and mortality outcomes in COVID-19 infection associated AIS among patients with and without COVID-19 vaccination.</p>
