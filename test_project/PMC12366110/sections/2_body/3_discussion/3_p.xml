Mechanical ventilation, hypoxia, and cytokine storms may induce oxidative DNA breaks in lung epithelial cells, which impair long-term respiratory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Fatigue and mitochondrial DNA damage: Fatigue (51.5% in intubated-ICU) correlated with high tail moment (11.5%). SARS-CoV-2 may disrupt mitochondrial function, leading to energy depletion and chronic fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Neurological symptoms (loss of smell/taste) and neuronal DNA damage: Viral invasion of olfactory neurons may cause DNA damage that delays neural regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Systemic inflammation and musculoskeletal pain: Musculoskeletal pain (17.8% in non-ICU) associated with moderate tail factor (5.9%). Persistent inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-&#945;) may contribute to DNA damage in muscle and joint tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The persistence of DNA damage raises concerns about long-term health consequences, including: Unrepaired DNA breaks may lead to oncogenic mutations, particularly in severely affected patients. Chronic genomic instability is linked to telomere shortening and cellular senescence, potentially accelerating aging-related diseases. Damaged DNA fragments may trigger autoantibodies, contributing to autoimmune-like symptoms in long COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
