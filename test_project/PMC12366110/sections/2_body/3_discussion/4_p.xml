By employing the alkaline comet assay, we demonstrated that post-COVID-19 patients exhibit significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls, with the severity of COVID-19 directly correlating with the extent of genomic instability. The highest levels of DNA damage were observed in intubated-ICU patients, followed by non-intubated-ICU and non-ICU patients. This suggests that the virus&#8217;s impact on the genome is not merely transient but may persist long after the acute phase of infection. This genomic instability could be a key factor underlying the enigmatic post-COVID-19 syndrome, a condition characterized by persistent symptoms that continue to afflict millions of survivors worldwide. The damage to DNA, as evidenced in this study, may contribute to a cascade of cellular dysfunctions, including impaired repair mechanisms, increased oxidative stress, and potential mutations that could predispose individuals to long-term health complications, such as chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, or even malignancies.</p>
