<p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par76">This study adds a novel biological dimension to our understanding of post-COVID-19 syndrome, highlighting that the virus&#8217;s impact extends far beyond the respiratory system. The genomic instability observed in survivors suggests that COVID-19 may leave a lasting imprint on the cellular level, potentially altering the trajectory of health in ways that are only beginning to be understood. This raises critical questions about the long-term consequences of the pandemic and underscores the need for targeted interventions to mitigate these effects. As we move forward, it is imperative to explore the mechanisms driving this genomic instability, whether through direct viral interference, immune-mediated damage, or systemic inflammation&#8212;and to develop strategies to protect or repair the genome in post-COVID-19 patients. This study serves as a call to action for further research into the biological underpinnings of post-COVID-19 syndrome, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for the millions of survivors who continue to grapple with its silent legacy. Future research should investigate whether this damage is reversible and whether targeted therapies (e.g., antioxidants, anti-inflammatories) can mitigate long-term effects. This review provides significant data aimed at enhancing our understanding of the long-term effects of COVID-19 and the necessity for research on DNA damage associated with specific viral agents. Understanding the physiological changes during COVID-19 could inform the development of subsequent conditions, identify symptom clusters associated with different levels of disease severity, and help clinicians prioritize patient care, allocate resources based on observed symptom burden, and develop prognostic models for predicting disease outcomes. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the temporal relationship between symptoms and disease progression, and studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm the statistical significance of the findings and assess the generalizability of the results to different populations.</p>
