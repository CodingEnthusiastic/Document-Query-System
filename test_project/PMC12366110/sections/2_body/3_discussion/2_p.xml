We explored the relationship between COVID-19 severity, DNA damage, and post-COVID syndrome, drawing on findings comparing healthy controls, non-ICU patients, non-intubated-ICU patients, and intubated-ICU patients. We employed comet assay parameters (tail length, tail intensity, tail moment, tail factor, and tail DNA percentage) to quantify DNA damage. Results revealed a clear dose-dependent relationship between COVID-19 severity and genomic instability: intubated-ICU patients showed the highest DNA damage. Tail intensity (25.8%) and tail length (23.2%) were significantly elevated, indicating severe DNA fragmentation. This group also exhibited the highest prevalence of post-COVID symptoms, including dyspnea (56.1%), fatigue (51.5%), and loss of smell/taste (36.1%). Non-intubated-ICU patients had intermediate damage; tail intensity (25.8%) was comparable to intubated patients, but tail length (15.4%) and tail moment (6.6%) were lower. Symptoms like chest pain (8.3%) and widespread myalgia (9.1%) were more pronounced than in non-ICU patients. Non-ICU patients still exhibited elevated DNA damage. Despite milder acute illness, tail length (7.9%) and tail intensity (19.6%) were significantly higher than in healthy controls. Symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain (17.8%) and fatigue (24.1%) persisted, suggesting long-term cellular dysfunction. The study found strong correlations between DNA damage severity and persistent symptoms, suggesting several mechanistic pathways:</p>
