The most prevalent definition indicates that long COVID-19 is characterized by symptoms persisting for more than three months from the onset of the initial symptoms, although various definitions exist. A review of available literature highlights that fatigue and dyspnea (shortness of breath) are the most frequently reported persistent symptoms associated with long COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The management and care for individuals with post-COVID-19 syndrome are anticipated to present significant challenges for healthcare systems globally. Current findings suggest critical directions for future research, particularly concerning the underlying pathophysiological processes associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome. Although numerous studies have provided intricate biological explanations for this condition, there still remains a gap in our understanding of the physiological pathways and mechanisms involved. As the long-term consequences of COVID-19 become more apparent, further information is expected to inform therapeutic approaches. Persistent abnormalities were observed in the cardiovascular system; for instance, 29% of 79 COVID-19 survivors exhibited radiological signs of ventricular remodeling three months after hospital discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Miwa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] reported concerning statistics showing that 90% of patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation continued to experience lung-related complications 100 days post-treatment, while 47% of those who did not require such ventilation displayed significant, prolonged reductions in pulmonary function. Furthermore, many individuals experience post-acute sequelae after receiving treatment for acute COVID-19. Chopra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] conducted an analysis on the long-term effects of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, revealing that a notable proportion reported ongoing symptoms like fatigue, dyspnea, and cognitive challenges even months post-discharge. This underscores the critical need for thorough follow-up care for individuals recovering from COVID-19, as many may struggle to regain their prior levels of health and activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The similarities in symptoms between post-COVID-19 syndrome and established autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, suggest that shared pathogenic mechanisms may be at work in individuals recovering from COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This emphasizes the necessity for ongoing research to better elucidate the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on immune function and the potential for targeted therapies to manage these autoimmune manifestations.</p>
