This virus has not only caused acute respiratory infections but also led to severe organ damage, contributing to an alarming rise in global morbidity and mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While many individuals recover from the acute phase of COVID-19, a growing body of research indicates that the sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection could profoundly impact patients&#8217; quality of life and their ability to resume daily activities and employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Common persistent symptoms include dyspnea, fatigue, anosmia, chest pain, ageusia, cognitive impairment, and arthralgia, which may manifest weeks after the initial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind these lingering symptoms remain poorly understood, but they appear to stem from a complex interplay of immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and potential direct viral effects on host tissues. Notably, the infection prompts an innate immune response characterized by an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and a procoagulant state, which may contribute to cellular damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recent studies have begun to explore the implications of DNA damage in this context, suggesting that viral manifestations may induce genomic instability, thus providing a rationale to investigate DNA damage as a potential underlying mechanism contributing to long-COVID symptoms. However, the direct causal links between DNA damage and specific long-COVID symptoms necessitate careful examination, particularly given that the current study is observational and cannot definitively infer causation but may identify correlations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is essential to acknowledge numerous potential confounders that might contribute to observed DNA damage, including systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, ICU interventions, pharmacologic exposures, and nutritional states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The variability in symptom presentation among individuals recovering from COVID-19 may also be significantly influenced by these factors, alongside age, pre-existing medical conditions, and the severity of the acute infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Understanding these complexities is crucial as ongoing investigations strive to untangle the multifactorial nature of post-COVID-19 syndrome and identify effective therapeutic strategies that address the broad spectrum of symptoms linked to this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, a critical understanding of the necessity for continuous patient care following acute COVID-19 is essential for addressing symptom persistence beyond four weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Rehabilitation programs that incorporate physical and cognitive therapies are currently being evaluated to aid in recovery, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive, patient-centered approach that considers mental health as well, given the prevalence of depression and anxiety among individuals recovering from the illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Ultimately, prioritizing patient education and support can empower individuals to seek medical assistance and engage in practices that promote their recovery and overall well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In summary, while recovery from acute COVID-19 is common, post-COVID-19 syndrome&#8217;s emergence poses significant challenges for healthcare providers. The exploration of DNA damage as a possible contributing factor to long-COVID symptoms is a novel area of inquiry that may yield crucial insights, necessitating further research focused on this potential linkage to enhance clinical outcomes for affected patients.</p>
