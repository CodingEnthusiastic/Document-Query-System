RNA was extracted from the swab samples using the Perkin Elmer Chemagic 360 system according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Briefly, the swabs were placed in viral transport medium, and RNA was isolated using magnetic bead-based extraction. The extracted RNA was subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the Viasure SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR detection kit (Cer Test Biotec SL, Spain). The kit targets the N1 and N2 genes of SARS-CoV-2. Each reaction mix included 5&#160;&#181;l of extracted RNA and 15&#160;&#181;l of master mix (containing primers, probes, and enzymes). The RT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: reverse transcription at 50&#160;&#176;C for 15&#160;min, initial denaturation at 95&#160;&#176;C for 2&#160;min, and amplification for 45 cycles at 95&#160;&#176;C for 15&#160;s and 60&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;s.</p>
