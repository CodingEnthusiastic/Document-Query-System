A total of 29 patients admitted to Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran in December 2024 were selected via a convenience sampling method and categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Participants received informed written consent and met the following criteria: age over 18 years and under 60 years old, non-smokers, no infectious disease (at least 30 days prior to study entry), not pregnant, and no underlying medical conditions.</p>
