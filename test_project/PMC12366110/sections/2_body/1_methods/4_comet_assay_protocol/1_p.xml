Using Singh et al.&#8216;s standard technique with modifications, 2&#160;ml of heparinized blood was mixed with 2&#160;ml of Ficoll and centrifuged at 1500&#160;rpm for 30&#160;min at 4&#160;&#176;C to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A suspension of 10&#160;&#181;l of PBMCs was mixed with 80&#160;&#181;l of 0.7% low-melting-point agarose at 37&#160;&#176;C, and the mixture was placed on slides under coverslips at 4&#160;&#176;C for solidification. The slides were then treated with a lysing solution containing Tris-HCl, EDTA, NaCl, SDS, and Triton X100 at low temperature (4&#160;&#176;C) before being incubated with alkaline electrophoresis buffer for 30&#160;min (10&#160;M NaOH and 200 mM EDTA-2Na) in an electrophoresis apparatus (25&#160;V/300&#160;mA for 25&#160;min). Post-drying, slides were neutralized, stained with ethidium bromide, and analyzed using an Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope. Comet assay images were analyzed quantitatively with OpenComet software. The damage index (DI) was calculated using formulas from Ivancsits et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
