Chi-square tests compared demographic variables across groups. To assess differences in comet means, T-tests and paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were employed after confirming normality and variance equality with Levene&#8217;s test and K-S tests. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparisons of assessment indices. Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient was utilized to evaluate correlations between DNA damage parameters and symptom severity. Statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01, and analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9 software.</p>
