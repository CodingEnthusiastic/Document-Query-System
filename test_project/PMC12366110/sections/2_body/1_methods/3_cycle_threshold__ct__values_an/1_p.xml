Based on the Ct values, patients were classified into the following severity groups: mild (non-ICU): Ct values&#8201;&gt;&#8201;30 (lower viral load), moderate (non-intubated ICU): Ct values 20&#8211;30 (moderate viral load), severe/critical (intubated ICU): Ct values&#8201;&lt;&#8201;20 (high viral load). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 (Ct values&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;40 or undetectable) were included as the control group.</p>
