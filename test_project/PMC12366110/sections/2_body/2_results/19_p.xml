In comparison, non-intubated-ICU patients had a tail length of 15.4&#160;&#956;m, non-ICU patients had 7.9&#160;&#956;m, and healthy subjects showed a tail length of 3.8&#160;&#956;m. Each of these parameters indicated a significant increase in DNA damage in all three patient groups compared to healthy individuals (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01), with the highest damage observed in the intubated group.</p>
