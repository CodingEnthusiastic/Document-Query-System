The tail moment values for the groups were as follows: 11.5 (intubated-ICU), 6.6 (non-intubated-ICU), 6.1 (non-ICU), and 1.4 (healthy individuals). All groups showed increased tail moment values compared to healthy subjects (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01). No significant difference existed between non-intubated-ICU and non-ICU groups (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.01), although both had significantly lower tail moments than the intubated-ICU patients (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01).</p>
