The demographics of COVID-19 patients during the post-COVID-19 period are summarized in Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The intubated-ICU group has the highest median age (46 years), indicating that older individuals are more likely to experience severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. The non-ICU group has the youngest median age (27 years). Males are more numerous than females in all groups, with the highest proportion in the intubated-ICU group (87.5%). The control group has an equal distribution of males and females (50% each). Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is a bar graph comparing the prevalence of various symptoms across four groups: healthy controls, non-ICU patients, non-intubated-ICU patients, and intubated-ICU patients. The symptoms listed on the x-axis include dyspnea, chest pain, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, widespread myalgia, loss of olfactory and gustatory function, fatigue, tightness of the chest, chills or sweats, and dry cough. The y-axis represents the percentage of individuals within each group experiencing each symptom.</p>
