Intubated-ICU patients typically show a higher rate of symptoms, indicating a more severe disease state. Within patient groups, there seems to be a trend of increasing symptom burden with increasing disease severity, evidenced by the higher prevalence of symptoms in intubated-ICU patients compared to non-intubated-ICU patients and non-ICU patients. Dyspnea, loss of smell and taste, fatigue, and chills are significantly more common in patients, especially in intubated-ICU cases.</p>
