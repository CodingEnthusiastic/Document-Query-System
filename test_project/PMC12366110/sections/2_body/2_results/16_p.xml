<p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Par63">An example of DNA damage among the groups studied is depicted in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, indicating that tail length correlates with the degree of DNA breakage, particularly in the intubated-ICU and non-intubated-ICU groups. The intubated-ICU group exhibited the highest levels of DNA damage during the post-COVID-19 phase, significantly lower than controls. All groups exhibited higher DNA damage when compared to the control group. Among COVID-19 severity phenotypes, the intubated-ICU group showed the most significant damage, followed by non-intubated-ICU patients. In Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, a cell with a normal nucleus and intact DNA, without a comet-like tail, is seen, which is called intact DNA. A cell with fragmented DNA is seen, where part of the DNA has broken away from the nucleus, forming a comet-like trail. The tail represents the damaged DNA fragments that have migrated due to electrophoresis. The head of the comet is called the nucleus, and the tail is called the DNA fragments. Small, medium, and large tails, which are precisely measured by the software, indicate different degrees of DNA damage. Smaller tails indicate less damage, while longer tails indicate more severe damage.</p>
