Again, all three patient groups had significantly higher results compared to healthy subjects (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01), with no significant difference between non-intubated-ICU and non-ICU patients (<italic>p</italic>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.01). Intubated-ICU patients recorded the highest tail DNA percentage. The distribution of DNA damage parameters was noted to be in the following order: tail intensity, tail length, tail moment, tail factor, and tail DNA percentage (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>
