These persistent symptoms can occur in individuals with both mild and severe COVID-19, though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore post-COVID-19 syndrome from a biological perspective, focusing on genomic instability.<h4>Methods</h4>In this cross-sectional study, the comet assay method was employed in March 2024 to evaluate the level of DNA damage in 29 patients to examine the post-COVID-19 syndrome state at Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran. Levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. Patients were categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests at a significance level of p\u2009<\u20090.01 in GraphPad Prism 9 software.<h4>Results</h4>Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls. The highest DNA damage was observed in intubated-ICU patients (mean DNA damage: 29.5%), followed by non-intubated-ICU patients (mean: 24.3%), non-ICU patients (mean: 19.1%), and healthy controls (mean: 9.4%). These findings suggest a clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and increased genomic instability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results of this study highlight the prevalence of DNA damage in post-COVID-19 patients, which may explain long-term genomic instability and associated health complications. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 syndrome, particularly its impact on genomic stability. This study contributes to the growing evidence that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition with virus-specific abnormalities affecting multiple biological pathways. Future studies should focus on understanding these mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for long-term COVID-19 survivors.", "affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, School of Biology, Institute of Biological Sciences, Damghan University, Damghan, Iran.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Genomic Instability"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Comet Assay"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Survivors"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Iran"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "COVID-19", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "CO", "qualifierName": "complications", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["DNA damage", "Comet assay", "Lymphopenia", "Covid-19", "Post-covid-19", "Long-term Covid-19"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-025-11419-y"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12366110"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12366110?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "N", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by-nc-nd", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2025-08-19", "dateOfCreation": "2025-08-19", "firstIndexDate": "2025-08-22", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-08-22", "dateOfRevision": "2025-08-22", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-08-19", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-08-19"}
