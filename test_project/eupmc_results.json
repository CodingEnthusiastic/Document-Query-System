It is particularly prevalent in intensive care unit settings, affecting up to 80% of ventilated patients. This study investigates whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) delirium aligns with expectations of non-COVID-19 delirium incidence in other hospitalized patients and identifies unique or common factors contributing to delirium in these groups.<h4>Methods</h4>An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 107 hospitalized patients diagnosed with delirium, comprising 56 COVID-19 patients and 51 non-COVID-19 patients. Data were collected through detailed medical record reviews and structured interviews with patients and their caregivers to evaluate factors associated with delirium.<h4>Results</h4>The findings revealed a higher prevalence of medication-related stressors in COVID-19 delirium compared to non-COVID-19 delirium. This suggests that overmedication may play a critical role in the development of delirium, regardless of the underlying critical illness condition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study highlights the significant association between medication stressors and COVID-19 delirium.

These persistent symptoms can occur in individuals with both mild and severe COVID-19, though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore post-COVID-19 syndrome from a biological perspective, focusing on genomic instability.<h4>Methods</h4>In this cross-sectional study, the comet assay method was employed in March 2024 to evaluate the level of DNA damage in 29 patients to examine the post-COVID-19 syndrome state at Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran. Levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. Patients were categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests at a significance level of p\u2009<\u20090.01 in GraphPad Prism 9 software.<h4>Results</h4>Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls. The highest DNA damage was observed in intubated-ICU patients (mean DNA damage: 29.5%), followed by non-intubated-ICU patients (mean: 24.3%), non-ICU patients (mean: 19.1%), and healthy controls (mean: 9.4%). These findings suggest a clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and increased genomic instability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results of this study highlight the prevalence of DNA damage in post-COVID-19 patients, which may explain long-term genomic instability and associated health complications. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 syndrome, particularly its impact on genomic stability. This study contributes to the growing evidence that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition with virus-specific abnormalities affecting multiple biological pathways. Future studies should focus on understanding these mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for long-term COVID-19 survivors.", "affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, School of Biology, Institute of Biological Sciences, Damghan University, Damghan, Iran.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Genomic Instability"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Comet Assay"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Survivors"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Iran"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "COVID-19", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "CO", "qualifierName": "complications", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["DNA damage", "Comet assay", "Lymphopenia", "Covid-19", "Post-covid-19", "Long-term Covid-19"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-025-11419-y"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12366110"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12366110?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "N", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by-nc-nd", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2025-08-19", "dateOfCreation": "2025-08-19", "firstIndexDate": "2025-08-22", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-08-22", "dateOfRevision": "2025-08-22", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-08-19", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-08-19"}, "PMC12216920": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "id": "40595733", "source": "MED", "pmid": "40595733", "pmcid": "PMC12216920", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC12216920"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41541-025-01158-1", "title": "Vaccination against COVID-19 and Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19 Infection and Stroke.", "authorString": "El Seblani N, Gorenflo MP, Ortega-Gutierrez S, Reichwein RK, Xu R, Nagaraja N.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "El Seblani N", "firstName": "Nader", "lastName": "El Seblani", "initials": "N", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Penn State Health Milton S.

Using the TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network, an international electronic health record database, we identified AIS cases admitted between April 1, 2021 and September 30, 2022 that had a COVID-19 diagnosis up to 30 days before hospitalization. The study cohort was divided into two groups: those with and without vaccination against COVID-19. The two groups were matched for demographics, comorbidities, and antithrombotics taken before AIS with 1:1 propensity score matching. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to report primary (all-cause mortality) and secondary outcomes at 7 and 30 days after AIS. We identified 3,573 vaccinated (71\u2009\u00b1\u200912 (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) years, 49% females) and 46,329 unvaccinated patients (65\u2009\u00b1\u200915 years, 45% females) who met the study criteria. After propensity score matching, 3,569 patients were in both groups. Vaccinated individuals had significantly lower rates of all-cause mortality [7 days: 3.3% vs 5.0%; HR\u2009=\u20090.66; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.52-0.83 and 30 days: 8.2% vs 9.5%; HR\u2009=\u20090.83; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.71-0.97], intracranial hemorrhage [7 days: 4.1% vs 6.2%; HR\u2009=\u20090.66; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.53-0.82 and 30 days: 4.5% vs 6.7%; HR\u2009=\u20090.66; 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.53-0.81], venous thromboembolism [7 days: 3.5% vs 7.8%; HR\u2009=\u20090.44; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.35-0.56 and 30-days: 4.6% vs 8.9%; HR\u2009=\u20090.51; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.41-0.63] and acute myocardial infarction [7 days: 4.1% vs 7.0%; HR\u2009=\u20090.58; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.46-0.73 and 30 days: 4.7% vs 7.6%; HR\u2009=\u20090.60; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.49-0.75)].
