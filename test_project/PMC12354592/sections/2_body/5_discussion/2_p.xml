The guidelines also have updated recommendations based on clinical studies. The authors of this review suggest that the prevention of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients requires the timely assessment of their thrombosis and bleeding risk, clarification of any anticoagulation contraindications, and the use of diagnostic tests to evaluate their hypercoagulable or fibrinolytic state to better apply treatment strategies.
