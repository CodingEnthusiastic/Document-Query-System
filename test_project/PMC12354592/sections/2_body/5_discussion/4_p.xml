<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The multinational and multicenter data included in this review summarize the clinical trials of anticoagulant therapy for COVID-19 patients. The differences in the studies may result from the different definitions, diagnostic methods and preventive management methods of all the included studies. In clinical trials, low-molecular-weight heparin/common liver and kidney drugs are often used, and there are a few mentions of new oral anticoagulants. The reason might be that anticoagulants such as heparin, LMWH or UFH have anti-inflammatory properties, which can inhibit the formation of thrombin and reduce inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>). The expected effect of heparin may also disrupt the lung-protective process of blood clotting, which could increase the survival rate of the host in COVID-19 (<xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>). Furthermore, the antiviral efficacy of heparin explains why it prevents entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by acting on the ACE-2 receptor and interacting with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (<xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>).</p>
