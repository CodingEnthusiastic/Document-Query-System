A review of 58 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B and associated intravascular thrombosis revealed 21 cases of pulmonary embolism (36.2%), 12 cases of DVT (20.6%) and 3 cases of DVT with pulmonary embolism (5.1%) (<xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>). Similar thrombotic complications were observed in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (<xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>). In a nationwide study conducted from 2012&#8211;2014, the incidence of thrombosis among patients hospitalized with acute viral respiratory illnesses, excluding COVID-19, was compared to the incidence among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 within a large health system in New York. That study revealed that 1.6% of patients with non-COVID-19 viral respiratory illnesses also experienced venous thromboembolism. Furthermore, from 2002 &#8211;2014, the proportion of hospitalized patients with viral respiratory diseases who developed thrombosis was significantly lower than that of patients with COVID-19 (5% versus 16%; P &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>). A further literature search revealed many similarities and differences between influenza and COVID-19. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity were significantly more common in COVID-19 patients, whereas lung disease and immunocompromised status were significantly more common in influenza patients. In terms of mechanism, both influenza and COVID-19 can cause a cytokine storm, which further stimulates inflammatory immunity to promote thrombogenesis (<xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>). That study revealed that TF expression was upregulated in lung epithelial cells, with concomitant increases in EVTF activity and coagulation activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) following influenza A virus infection in murine models. Similarly, mice infected with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2 presented elevated lung TF expression. Furthermore, patients suffering from severe respiratory tract infections demonstrated high levels of TF expression, strongly indicating that this upregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of thrombosis (<xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>).</p>
