The value of D-dimers in predicting the risk of VTE in COVID-19 patients has been demonstrated by numerous clinical studies, such as a multicenter study in France that revealed that the cooccurrence of elevated D-dimers (&gt;3000 &#956;g/L) and elevated white blood cell count (&#8805;12.0&#215;10<sup>9</sup>/L) was significantly associated with PE. Among many clinical laboratory indicators, D-dimers have the highest predictive value for VTE. In addition to the acute phase of infection, studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with higher peak D-dimer levels (&gt;3000 &#956;g/L) have an approximately fourfold increased risk of VTE after being cured and discharged (<xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>). In clinical trials, some of which also included patients with moderate COVID-19, therapeutic heparin was not significantly associated with a reduction in the primary outcome in moderate patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer levels but was associated with a reduced chance of death within 28 days; in the trial, the risk of major bleeding appeared to be low (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). In addition to existing anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents, nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), a potent TF inhibitor, was investigated in the ASPEN-COVID-19 trial. rNAPc2 was found to be well tolerated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with no excessive bleeding or serious adverse events, but its ability to reduce the level of D-dimers was not significantly greater than that of heparin at day 8 (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). Fibrin amyloid microclots have been extensively observed in cases of long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the disease known as long COVID-19. These microclots have the capacity to obstruct capillaries, consequently impeding the passage of red blood cells and hindering oxygen exchange. This obstruction can result in the formation of microthrombi. Consequently, the development and careful monitoring of anticoagulation and antiplatelet treatment regimens in randomized clinical trials could present a viable therapeutic strategy (<xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>). In a similar manner, fibrin interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to form proinflammatory clots, which contribute to systemic thromboinflammation and neuropathology in COVID-19 patients. A monoclonal antibody that targets the inflammatory domain of fibrin has been shown to protect against microglial activation, neuronal injury, and thrombotic inflammation in the postinfection lung. Consequently, fibrin plays a pivotal role in the inflammation and neuropathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that fibrin-targeted immunotherapy could serve as a potential therapeutic intervention for patients experiencing both acute and long-term effects of COVID-19 (<xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>). These findings also provide some ideas for our future research direction. We look forward to the results of more studies in the future and advancements in the guidelines.</p>
