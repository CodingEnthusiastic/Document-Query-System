A recent study revealed that patients with COVID-19 are more likely to develop venous thromboembolism (PE: 1.0&#8211;40.0%, DVT: 0.4&#8211;84%) than arterial thromboembolism (stroke: 0.5&#8211;15.2%, myocardial infarction: 0.8&#8211;8.7%). Finally, the all-cause mortality rate for COVID-19 patients ranges from 4.8% to 63%, whereas the mortality rate associated with thromboembolic complications ranges from 5% to 48% (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A systematic review and meta-analysis of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19 from the start of the pandemic through August 31, 2021, involving 63 studies (104,920 patients with COVID-19) revealed an overall thrombotic rate of 21% (95% CI, 18%&#8211;25%). The deep vein thrombosis rate was 20% (95% CI, 16% ~ 25%), the pulmonary embolism rate was 8% (95% CI, 6% ~ 10%), and the arterial thrombosis rate was 5% (95% CI, 3% ~ 7%). The prevalence of all major outcomes in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) significantly increased (P&lt;0.05). The incidence of total thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in elderly patients significantly increased (P&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Furthermore, despite the implementation of anticoagulation prophylaxis, hospitalized individuals continue to face increased susceptibility to venous thromboembolism (VTE) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Almost all of the above findings are based on hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These findings are based on populations in an inpatient setting, but data on the incidence of venous thromboembolism events, such as acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), among individuals recovering from COVID-19 are limited. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the risk of acute PE and DVT in this population. The study included a total of 29,078,950 patients, with a mean age of 50.2 years, 63.9% of whom were male. Among these, 2,060,960 patients had been infected with COVID-19. The cumulative incidence rates of PE and DVT in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 were 1.2% (95% CI: 0.9&#8211;1.4, I: 99.8%) and 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7&#8211;3.0, I: 99.7%), respectively. During the same follow-up period, the hazard ratios for developing PE and DVT in recovered COVID-19 patients were 3.16 (95% CI: 2.63&#8211;3.79, I: 90.1%) and 2.55 (95% CI: 2.09&#8211;3.11, I: 92.6%), respectively (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A separate study incorporated inpatient participants with primary care records from the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, as well as outpatient specialist records from Germany. The 90-day cumulative incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients ranged from 0.2% to 0.8%, increasing to as high as 4.5% among hospitalized patients. The incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients was correlated with an elevated risk of mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 4.42 [95% CI: 3.07&#8211;6.36] for nonhospitalized patients and 1.63 [95% CI: 1.39&#8211;1.90] for hospitalized patients. Similarly, the development of arterial thromboembolism was linked to an increased risk of death, with hazard ratios of 3.16 [95% CI: 2.65&#8211;3.75] for nonhospitalized patients and 1.93 [95% CI: 1.57-2.37] for hospitalized patients (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Overall, the prevalence of COVID-19 was greater in women than in men. In a 2022 European network cohort study involving 909,473 COVID-19 patients and 32,329 COVID-19 hospitalizations, there were more COVID-19 cases in women than in men across all databases (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis also reported that the prevalence of post-COVID-19 syndrome by sex was 47.23% (95% CI: 44.03&#8211;50.42%) in men and 52.77% (95% CI: 49.58&#8211;55.97%) in women (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). For patients with COVID-19 and thrombosis, a prospective study identified 1106 patients with venous thromboembolism associated with COVID-19 (age, 62.3 &#177; 14.4 years; 62.9% male) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Interestingly, women appear to be less likely to develop severe disease, despite the data collected thus far that more women are affected and that the mortality rate in women is lower than that in men. The role of female hormones in regulating inflammation may be the reason behind this sex difference.</p>
