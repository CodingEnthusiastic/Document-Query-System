<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is primarily a respiratory viral infection; it has had a catastrophic impact on the world&#8217;s population, resulting in more than 6.5 million deaths worldwide. This represents the worst global health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The primary impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection is on the pulmonary system, however, emerging evidence suggests that it may also have implications for the vascularity of the extrapulmonary system, either through direct viral infection or indirectly through cytokine storms (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Studies have shown that COVID-19 induces a prethrombotic state (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Thrombosis of both microvessels and large vessels is prevalent among COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are frequently observed thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19. Arterial thrombosis is a notable occurrence in COVID-19 patients, leading to various complications, such as acute ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute limb ischemia (ALI), mesenteric infarction, renal infarction, and spleen infarction (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
