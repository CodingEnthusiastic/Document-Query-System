<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">COVID-19 can lead to a variety of pathophysiological changes and clinical symptoms. Although symptoms usually last only 2&#8211;3 weeks, after the acute phase, approximately 10% of patients develop persistent or new symptoms, a condition known as long COVID-19/postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (<xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>). Long COVID-19 has the potential to impact multiple organ systems, resulting in significant and lasting functional impairments attributable to organ damage. The resulting burden of this disease on individuals, healthcare systems, and national economies is substantial (<xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>). Cardiovascular complications (including thromboembolic diseases) have emerged as a key issue in PASC (<xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>, <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>). So far, the main potential pathophysiological mechanisms related to vascular complications include immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, endothelial dysfunction (ED), coagulopathy, etc. Although the acute phase of cardiovascular complications is characterized by excessive inflammation and coagulation dysfunction, the mechanisms driving the persistent cardiovascular dysfunction in PASC remain poorly understood (<xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>). Furthermore, numerous procoagulant inflammatory molecules have been identified within microclots associated with long COVID-19. These molecules include &#945;2-antifibrinolytic protein (&#945;2AP), von Willebrand factor (vWF), platelet factor 4 (PF4), serum amyloid A (SAA), various fibrinogen chains, and a range of antibodies (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Notably, circulating NET biomarkers do not return to normal levels until approximately 4 months after infection (<xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>). In cases of long COVID-19, feedback loops involving NETs and thrombosis establish a cycle characterized by coagulation, inflammation, and localized hypoxia, which contributes to the severity of COVID-19 and the persistence of long-term symptoms.</p>
