<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">New evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction within immune cells may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PASC, especially in relation to cardiovascular sequelae (<xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>). Mitochondria play a crucial role in the generation of cellular energy, the function of immune cells, regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell apoptosis, among other processes. (<xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>) Mitochondria are usually the targets of viral proteins, which can lead to disruptions in biological energy and changes in the immune response (<xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). Meanwhile, monocytes also rely heavily on mitochondrial function to maintain innate immunity and vascular homeostasis. Mitochondrial damage can also lead to a decline in monocyte function (<xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>). In long-term COVID patients, the persistent oxidative stress leads to continuous mitochondrial damage and cellular dysfunction, thereby perpetuating the cycle of inflammation and tissue damage (<xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>, <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>). Furthermore, genetic factors and genetic polymorphisms may also contribute to an increased susceptibility of long COVID patients to vascular complications (<xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>). For example, the polymorphisms of genes related to blood coagulation, F5 (R506Q) and F2 (G20210A), can increase the susceptibility to thromboembolic events by enhancing procoagulant activity or reducing anticoagulant regulation. In COVID-19, these polymorphisms work in synergy with a high inflammatory state, resulting in excessive thrombus formation in the pulmonary vessels, which leads to pulmonary thromboembolism (<xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>, <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>).</p>
