<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">For antithrombotic treatment, the CHEST guidelines (<xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>, <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>), Anticoagulation Forum guidelines (<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>) and &#8216;Guidelines for Thrombosis Prevention and Anticoagulation Management in Hospitalized Patients with Novel Coronavirus Infection&#8217; refer to anticoagulation therapy for COVID-19 patients with thromboembolism. It is recommend that most patients who are diagnosed with VTE while hospitalized for COVID-19 receive anticoagulation therapy for a minimum of three to six months. For critically ill COVID-19 patients with proximal DVT or PE, we suggest parenteral rather than oral anticoagulant therapy. For critically ill COVID-19 patients with proximal DVT or PE who are treated with parenteral anticoagulation, we suggest LMWH or fondaparinux over UFH. In patients with COVID-19 and recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation with apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or edoxaban (and documented compliance) or vitamin K antagonist therapy (in the therapeutic range), we suggest switching treatment to therapeutic weight-adjusted LMWH.</p>
