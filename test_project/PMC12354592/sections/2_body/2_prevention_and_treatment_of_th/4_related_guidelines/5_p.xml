<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Critically ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19: In the absence of contraindications, all guidelines recommend anticoagulant prophylaxis in critically ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19. All guidelines (including domestic guidelines) recommend the use of a prophylactic dose for patients with COVID-19-related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism. For critically ill patients with COVID-19, the CHEST guidelines (<xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>, <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>) recommend against routine ultrasound screening for asymptomatic DVT and adding mechanical prophylaxis to drug thrombus prophylaxis. CHEST guidelines recommend mechanical thromboprophylaxis if drug thromboprophylaxis is contraindicated in critically ill COVID-19 patients. In addition, the domestic guidelines make other recommendations (<xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>). For hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, if there is a high risk of VTE and a low risk of bleeding and the disease has a tendency to worsen (such as a progressive increase in D-dimers and exacerbation of hypoxemia), the use of a therapeutic dose of LMWH/UFH anticoagulation is recommended. If bleeding is a high risk, mechanical prophylaxis is recommended. After the risk of bleeding is reduced, drug prophylaxis combined with mechanical prophylaxis should be carried out in time. The Anticoagulation Forum Guidelines (<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>) suggest that posthospital thromboprophylaxis with 10 mg of rivaroxaban daily for 35 days following hospitalization for COVID-19 may be considered in select patients at increased risk of thromboembolism (e.g., IMPROVE VTE score&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;4 or score 2&#8211;3 with elevated D-dimers at hospital discharge) and not at increased risk of bleeding, regardless of the intensity of their inpatient thromboprophylaxis.</p>
