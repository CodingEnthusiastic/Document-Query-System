<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients: The ISTH guidelines define those who are &#8220;not hospitalized&#8221; as people with COVID-19 who live in the community and have not recently been hospitalized for COVID-19 (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). Guidelines suggest that initiating direct oral anticoagulant therapy or antiplatelet therapy does not effectively reduce the risk of hospitalization, arterial or venous thromboembolism, or death in symptomatic COVID-19 patients who are not hospitalized. In nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients at increased risk of disease progression, the initiation of oral sulodexide treatment within 3 days of symptom onset may be considered to reduce the risk of hospitalization. In asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, LMWH for preventing blood clots is not effective in reducing the risk of disease progression (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>).</p>
