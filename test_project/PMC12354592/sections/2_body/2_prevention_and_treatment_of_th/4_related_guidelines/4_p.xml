<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Noncritically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19: For inpatients, most foreign guidelines classify hospitalized nonpregnant adult patients with COVID-19 without evidence of VTE into two categories: noncritically or acutely ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (in the general inpatient ward) and critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (in the ICU). Low-dose (prophylactic/standard) LMWH or UFH should be used in noncritically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to reduce thromboembolism and the possible risk of death, and it is recommend that clinicians consider the therapeutic intensity of LMWH or UFH thromboprophylaxis in noncritically ill patients at increased risk of disease progression or thromboembolism and not at high risk of anticoagulation-related bleeding (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). In the Guidelines for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in adults in China, anticoagulation prevention is also recommended for mild and general COVID-19 patients with medical or surgical conditions who are assessed as having a high or medium-high risk of VTE on the basis of the Padua score or Caprini score and who have no anticoagulation conjunctivitis (<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). The ASH guidelines also recommend the use of anticoagulant therapy with standard prophylactic intensity over therapeutic intensity for patients with COVID-19-related acute illness without suspected or confirmed VTE or other anticoagulant indications (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>). The NIH guidelines further recommend the use of therapeutic doses of heparin in patients with D-dimer levels above the upper limit of normal who require low oxygen flow and are not at increased risk of bleeding (<xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>).</p>
