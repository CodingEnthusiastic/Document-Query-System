<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Discharged patients: All guidelines recommend against routinely continuing VTE prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge unless they have another indication for anticoagulation. According to the Guidelines for Thrombosis Prevention and Anticoagulation Management in Hospitalized Patients with Novel Coronavirus Infection (<xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>), if a high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding are assessed before discharge, drug prophylaxis with NOACs can be recommended. If a high risk of VTE and a high risk of bleeding are assessed before discharge, mechanical prophylaxis (such as GCS) or early activity is recommended. For hospitalized patients with COVID-19, if out-of-hospital prophylaxis is assessed before discharge, prophylaxis should be prolonged depending on the risk of VTE or until the risk factors are removed. The ISTH guidelines (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>) suggest that in select high-risk patients who have been hospitalized for COVID-19, postdischarge treatment with prophylactic-dose rivaroxaban for approximately 30 days may be considered to reduce the risk of major thromboembolism. In patients who have been hospitalized for COVID-19 and are not deemed at high risk for complications, routine postdischarge prophylactic doses of direct oral anticoagulants are not recommended to reduce the risk of death or thromboembolism.</p>
