The author of this article hypothesizes that there are several possible reasons. The pathophysiological mechanism of the patients undergoes dynamic changes. For mild/moderate patients, it is mainly characterized by vascular endothelial micro-inflammation and local hypercoagulability, with limited thrombin production. Therefore, the effect of heparin-like drugs is limited. While for severe patients, &#8220;immune thrombosis&#8221; occurs (immunothrombosis), NETs are released and systemic coagulation activation takes place. In addition to their anticoagulant effect, using heparin can also neutralize the histones of NETs (through negative charge binding), exerting an anti-inflammatory effect. However, DOACs do not have this effect. From the perspective of pharmacokinetics, there are differences among patients with varying degrees of severity.</p>
