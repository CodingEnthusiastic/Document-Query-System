<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Among the clinical trials described above, in addition to the heparin anticoagulant regimen, several trials evaluated the efficacy of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and a TF inhibitor in preventing blood clots in COVID-19 patients. rNAPc2 is a novel TF inhibitor with anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and potentially antiviral properties. Therefore, the ASPEN-COVID-19 trial utilized rNAPc2 to investigate whether TF could be a therapeutic target for COVID-19 thrombus prophylaxis. Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, TF inhibition with rNAPc2 as the only anticoagulant was safe and well tolerated but did not significantly reduce D-dimer levels more than the heparin standard of care. The NCT04542408 trial evaluated edoxaban, but the trial data and results were not published. In the FREEDOM COVID anticoagulation strategy randomized trial, 3398 noncritically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive a prophylactic dose of enoxaparin (n=1141), a therapeutic dose of enoxaparin (n=1136), or a therapeutic dose of apixaban (n=1121). The results were similar in both treatment dose groups, with major bleeding uncommon in all three groups (<xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>). ACTION is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial: patients (aged &#8805;18 years) who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and had elevated D-dimer concentrations and symptoms of COVID-19 for up to 14 days prior to randomization were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive therapeutic or preventive anticoagulant therapy. Therapeutic anticoagulant therapy was oral rivaroxaban at hospitalization (20 mg or 15 mg daily) for stable patients and an initial subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily) or intravenous injection of UFH (target 0-3-0&#8211;7 IU/mL anti-Xa concentration), followed by rivaroxaban until day 30, for clinically unstable patients. There was no difference in primary efficacy outcomes among patients receiving therapeutic and preventive anticoagulant therapy. Compared with prophylactic anticoagulation, in-hospital anticoagulation treatment of up to 30 days of rivaroxaban or enoxaparin did not improve clinical outcomes, and bleeding increased (<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>).</p>
