</xref>). Among them, only one clinical trial (NCT04354155) (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>) has been conducted in children. The remaining clinical trials were conducted in adult patients. The COVID-19 study population was divided into nonhospitalized and hospitalized patients on the basis of the severity of the infection. Hospitalized patients were divided into noncritically ill and critically ill COVID-19 patients. Most of the clinical trials used the anticoagulant drugs unfractionated heparin (UFH)/low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Interestingly, these trials focused on thrombosis prevention.</p>
