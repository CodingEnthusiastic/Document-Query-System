<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In a clinical trial involving nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients, the incidence of cardiovascular events in the enoxaparin group was 0.9%, whereas that in the control group was 1.7% (relative risk 0.51; 95% confidence interval: 0.09&#8211;2.75). However, the early use of enoxaparin did not improve the course of the disease in patients with COVID-19 (<xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). In another nonhospitalized COVID-19 patient clinical trial, 8 patients who received enoxaparin experienced severe adverse reactions (<xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). A systematic review evaluated the efficacy of prolonged thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients after discharge, including eight studies with a total of 10,148 patients. The results confirmed that prolonged thromboprophylaxis, mainly prophylactic use of anticoagulants for &lt;35 days, was significantly associated with a poor overall prognosis in high-risk patients with COVID-19 after discharge (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.41&#8211;0.67; P=0.000). Prolonged thromboprophylaxis did not increase the risk of major bleeding events (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 0.95&#8211;2.82, P= 0.075) (<xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>).</p>
