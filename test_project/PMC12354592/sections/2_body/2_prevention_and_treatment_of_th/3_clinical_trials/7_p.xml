A total of 682 patients were enrolled, and this trial revealed that full-dose anticoagulation was superior to clopidogrel antiplatelet prevention for thrombosis, reducing the incidence of thrombotic events but increasing bleeding, which was mainly due to blood transfusions in patients with stable hemodynamics, with no significant increase in mortality. Owing to the decline in the incidence of ICU-level COVID-19, recruitment was discontinued in March 2022 (planned enrollment was 50%) (<xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). The HEP-COVID-19 multicenter randomized clinical trial assessed the efficacy of therapeutic doses of LMWH compared with standard prophylactic or medium-dose heparin in preventing COVID-19-related thrombosis in high-risk hospitalized patients. The trial also stratified patients on the basis of their ICU status, with 83 out of 257 randomized patients (32.8%) being in the ICU (<xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). Among the patients in the standard-dose group, 52 (41.9%) met the primary efficacy endpoint. In comparison, 37 (28.7%) patients in the therapeutic dose group met the primary efficacy endpoint. The incidence of thromboembolism decreased significantly from 29.0% to 10.9% (RR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21&#8211;0.66; P &lt; 0.001). Major bleeding occurred in 1.6% of the patients in the standard-dose heparin group and 4.7% of those in the therapeutic-dose heparin group (RR 2.88; 95% CI, 0.99&#8211;14.02; P = 0.17). The primary outcome measures were reduced in non-ICU patients (36.1% vs. 16.7%; RR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27&#8211;0.81; P = 0.004), whereas no significant difference was observed in ICU patients (55.3% vs. 51.1%; RR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62&#8211;1.39; P = 0.71). Compared with standard heparin thromboprophylaxis, therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduced the incidence of major thromboembolism and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with markedly elevated D-dimer levels. Conversely, no therapeutic benefit was observed in patients admitted to the ICU.</p>
