One study compared two treatment regimens for noncritical hospitalized patients with COVID-19: one was a therapeutic dose of heparin anticoagulation therapy, and the other was a standard nursing drug for thrombosis prevention therapy. Among the 2219 patients ultimately included, initial therapeutic-dose heparin anticoagulant therapy improved the probability of survival to discharge while reducing the use of cardiovascular or respiratory support compared with conventional thromboprophylaxis. However, the incidence of major bleeding was greater in the group that received the therapeutic dose (1.9% vs. 0.9%) (<xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). Another trial compared patients with severe illness, with 1098 patients divided into 534 receiving treatment-dose anticoagulation and 564 receiving standard care thrombosis prophylaxis. The proportion of patients surviving to discharge was similar in both groups (62.7% and 64.5%, respectively; adjusted relative advantage, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.64&#8211;1.11). A total of 3.8% of patients receiving treatment-dose anticoagulation had major bleeding, compared with 2.3% of patients receiving standard care thrombosis prophylaxis. In COVID-19 critically ill patients, the strategy of initial treatment-dose heparin anticoagulation compared with standard care pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis did not result in a greater probability of survival to discharge or more days without cardiovascular or respiratory organ support (<xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). The NCT04360824 (<xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>) and INSPIRATION (<xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>) trials compared the efficacy and safety of different doses in critically ill patients and reported no significant difference in thrombotic or bleeding events between moderate and standard doses of enoxaparin. However, the therapeutic dose of enoxaparin in the HESACOVID trial (<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>) improved gas exchange and reduced the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19. One meta-analysis included studies comparing therapeutic or intermediate anticoagulation versus prophylactic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients, including 6 RCTs with 4678 patients and 4 cohort studies with 1080 patients. In randomized controlled trials, therapeutic anticoagulation or intermediate anticoagulation was associated with a significant reduction in thromboembolic events (5 studies, n=4,664; relative risk [RR], 0.72; P=0.01) and significantly increased bleeding events (5 studies, n=4,667; RR1.88; P= 0.004). In moderate patients, therapeutic or moderate anticoagulation was more beneficial than prophylactic anticoagulation for thromboembolic events, but the number of bleeding events was significantly greater. In severely ill patients, the incidence of thromboembolism and bleeding events occurs at or in the middle of treatment. It is suggested that patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 infection should be treated with preventive anticoagulation therapy (<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>). In another systematic review, which included 33 studies (11,387 patients), standard heparin prophylaxis versus high (intermediate or therapeutic) heparin regimens was evaluated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The incidence of VTE events was 5.2% and 8.2% with high- or standard-dose heparin prophylaxis, respectively (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55&#8211;0.90, 1248.8%). Major bleeding was significantly greater in patients receiving the high dose than in those receiving the standard dose (4.2% vs. 2.2%, RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.47&#8211;2.56, 1218.1%) (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>).</p>
