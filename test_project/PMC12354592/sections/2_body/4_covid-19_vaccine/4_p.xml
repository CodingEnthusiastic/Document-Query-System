<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The primary intervention for VITT management is immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (<xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>). It can rapidly increase platelet count (usually within 24&#8211;48 hours) and reduce the risk of thrombosis progression (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>). If IVIG is ineffective or in severe cases (such as multiple organ thrombosis), glucocorticoids can be used as an adjunctive treatment (<xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>). Anticoagulation therapy should prefer non-heparin anticoagulants(typically argatroban infusion or fondaparinux) (<xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>). Additionally, platelet transfusion should be avoided unless there is life-threatening bleeding, and it should be used after IVIG (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). For refractory VITT, intensified treatment can also consider plasma exchange (TPE) (<xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>).</p>
