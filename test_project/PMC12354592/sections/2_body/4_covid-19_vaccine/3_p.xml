Studies have shown that patients who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (such as ChAdOx1 or nCoV-19) developed thrombosis or thrombocytopenia, which is referred to as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) (<xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>). As a result, many countries have restricted their use in young patients. The main mechanisms include that Anti-PF4 antibody-mediated platelet activation, vaccine components trigger immune responses, and adenovirus vector vaccines may release free DNA or negatively charged proteins (such as spike proteins), which combine with platelet factor 4 (PF4) to form PF4-polyanion complexes (<xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>). Anti-PF4 antibodies can also activate platelets through the Fc&#947;RIIa receptor, leading to platelet aggregation, thrombosis, and secondary thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>). In addition, autoantibodies are produced, and some individuals develop anti-PF4 antibodies (similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, HIT), but unlike HIT, VITT patients usually have no history of heparin exposure (<xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>). Activated platelets release procoagulant microparticles, and endothelial injury triggers the expression of TF, promoting widespread thrombosis (<xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>).</p>
