<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Overall, the currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are effective in reducing the incidence and mortality rates associated with the disease (<xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>). Real-world studies show that vaccination reduces the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization by 85-95% and the risk of severe disease by 91% (Delta variant era data) (<xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>). Although vaccines may cause extremely rare blood clots (such as VITT, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 250,000 doses) (<xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>), the risk of blood clot caused by COVID-19 itself is even higher (about 16.5% of hospitalized patients develop VTE) (<xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>). Mathematical models show that vaccination can prevent more than 40 times the number of thrombosis-related deaths (<xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>). A study analyzed the VTE cases of 792,010 patients who received the authorized COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. The results showed that there was no increase in the risk of VTE after vaccination compared to before vaccination (<xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>). That is to say, the benefits of global vaccination for individuals and the public far outweigh the adverse effects of the vaccines (<xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>).</p>
