Different from simple NETs or cytokine storm in COVID-19 (<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). Studies have shown that the activity levels of EV-related TF in COVID-19 patients are higher than those in the control group (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). The activity of EV-related TF is closely related to the D-dimer level, which is a marker of thrombosis in this patient group. The EV level is also associated with prothrombin time, fibrinogen level, plasmin-antiplasmin complex, von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS13 (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). Another study compared severely ill COVID patients with non-COVID patients with septic shock and found that COVID-19 patients had a higher pro-coagulant effect, and the EV-TF activity was significantly higher (<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>).</p>
