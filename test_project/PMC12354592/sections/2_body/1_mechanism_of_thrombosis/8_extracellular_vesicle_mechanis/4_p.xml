<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">EVs facilitate the coagulation process via the exposure of phosphatidylserine, providing a catalytic surface to facilitate the formation of the tenase (factors VIIIa, IXa, and X) and prothrombinase (factors Va, Xa, and II) complexes of the coagulation cascade (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). And EVs initiate clotting by surface expression of tissue factor (TF) under inflammatory conditions (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). Studies have characterized the expression of TF in clinical samples from patients with severe COVID-19, and it was found that the ratio of TF to EV was greater than 15% (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>).</p>
