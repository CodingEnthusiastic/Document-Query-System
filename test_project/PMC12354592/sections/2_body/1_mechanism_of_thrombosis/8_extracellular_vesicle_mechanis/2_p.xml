<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-enclosed particles secreted by cells, capable of transferring proteins, lipids, metabolites, nucleic acids, and organelles to other cells, and are typically found in distant tissues throughout the body. EVs exhibit considerable heterogeneity, with sizes ranging from 20 nanometers (nm) to 1 micrometer. They can be categorized based on size, with exosomes representing the smaller end of the spectrum and microvesicles (formerly referred to as microparticles) representing the larger end. EVs are released by various cell types, including platelets, megakaryocytes, white blood cells, endothelial cells, and red blood cells, and these cells may be influenced by the effects mediated by EVs. EVs perform multiple functions, such as facilitating cell-cell communication, removing cellular waste or recycling molecules, and mediating host-pathogen interactions. Platelet-derived EVs may originate from the plasma membrane of resting platelets or from &#945; granules following platelet activation. EVs derived from endothelial cells and monocytes express selectin, TF, vWF, other coagulation factors, and negatively charged phosphatidylserine, all of which can contribute to thrombosis. Additionally, circulating EVs may play a role in regulating inflammation and vascular permeability (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>).</p>
