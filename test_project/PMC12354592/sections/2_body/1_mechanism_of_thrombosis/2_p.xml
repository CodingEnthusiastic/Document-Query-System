Coagulation involves a series of enzymatic reactions leading to thrombin production and fibrin formation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The coagulation pathways include two main pathways: the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway. In addition, the common pathway converges on factor X (FX). The coagulation pathway activates coagulation factors through a cascade of activation, also known as the coagulation cascade. The extrinsic pathway is the main structural element of the coagulation process; components of the extrinsic and common pathways are essential for coagulation, whereas components of the intrinsic pathway are needed to amplify thrombin production. Repeated activation and amplification trigger the intrinsic pathway driven by thrombin (under certain conditions driven by FXIIa) to accelerate thrombin and fibrin formation. Both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of the coagulation system are initially triggered by the release of active tissue factor (TF), the formation of TF complexes with FVIIa, and the subsequent activation of FX directly to FXa or through the FIXa pathway (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Certain scholars posit that SARS-CoV-2 could exacerbate thrombosis by exerting various distinct and comprehensive influences on intravascular dysfunction, platelet activation and aggregation, the initiation of the coagulation cascade, the activation of eicosanoid pathways, and the disruption of fibrinolysis (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Research has revealed that the levels of circulating inflammatory markers (CCL23 and IL-6) and vascular dysfunction markers (ACE-2 and TF) are significantly greater in individuals with severe illness than in those with mild illness (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Recent research suggests that the mechanisms underlying thrombosis in individuals with COVID-19 are primarily initiated by vascular endothelial damage, dysregulation of the body&#8217;s coagulation system, the presence of viral particles, and subsequent immune responses. This process is multifactorial in nature (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In summary, inflammation facilitates thrombosis, which subsequently exacerbates the inflammatory response. Inflammation alters the functional phenotype of endothelial cells from an antithrombotic to a thrombotic state, thereby promoting the activation of the coagulation cascade. Thrombin generated during thrombotic events further amplifies inflammation by stimulating cells that express protease-activated receptors (PARs) to secrete cytokines. Furthermore, activated platelets engage with inflammatory and endothelial cells, enhancing neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and cytokine release (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).
