On the left, a virus with spike proteins binds to ACE-2 receptors on endothelial cells. On the right, pathways leading to a hypercoagulable state and endothelial damage are shown, including the renal angiotensin-aldosterone system disorder, cytokine storm, hypoxia, and other factors. These pathways involve increased Ang II, TF, and Coagulation FXa, leading to thrombus formation and endothelial cell damage.</alt-text></graphic></fig>
