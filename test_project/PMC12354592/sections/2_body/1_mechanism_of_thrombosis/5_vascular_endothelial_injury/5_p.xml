The interaction between the viral spike protein and the cellular receptor can trigger the inflammatory pathway, alter the mitochondrial metabolism of microvascular endothelial cells, and induce significant production of coagulation factor Xa, resulting in a hypercoagulable state (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,&#160;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). this also leads to excessive thrombin production and reduced fibrinolysis, and thrombin can cause further endothelial damage (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Moreover, The increased expression of ICAM1, SELP, and CX3CL1 may suggest that endothelial cells from the site of vascular injury are in a proinflammatory and procoagulant state (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). serum from patients with COVID-19 can modify the functional characteristics of endothelial cells through the activation of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2), leading to increased apoptosis, compromised barrier integrity, and increased propensity for blood clotting (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Moreover, endothelial dysfunction is facilitated by PAR-2, whereby certain clotting mediators (e.g., FIIa, FVIIa, and FXa) can trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines, thus perpetuating a detrimental cycle (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Endodermatitis induced by SARS-CoV-2 results in the release of elevated levels of vWF, a glycoprotein originating from activated endothelial cells, platelets, or subendothelial cells that plays a crucial role in mediating platelet adhesion and aggregation. The significant increase in vWF levels observed in individuals with COVID-19 signifies endothelial damage or impairment, promoting platelet aggregation at the site of injury and potentially leading to hyperactivation of the coagulation pathway, thereby initiating thrombotic events (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Concurrently, a reduction in a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13) levels was noted, suggesting an imbalanced vWF: ADAMTS-13 ratio that could contribute to thrombotic occurrences. Both the vWF/ADAMTS-13 ratio and PF4 level are increased, indicating that prolonged endothelial cell activation leads to increased platelet aggregation after COVID-19 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p>
