<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">COVID-19 patients often suffer from severe hypoxia, and hypoxia can also lead to endothelial dysfunction and coagulation. Hypoxia upregulates P-selectin and adhesion molecules (such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1) to induce the recruitment of platelets and leukocytes (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Furthermore, hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) promote thrombosis by increasing the release of the inflammatory cytokine PAI-1 by endothelial cells while downregulating thrombomodulin expression (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Specifically, HIF-&#945; downregulates the expression of the complement regulator CD55. This downregulation increases the release of C3a and the deposition of caspase 3 on endothelial cells, thereby further increasing complement-mediated endothelial damage in patients with COVID-19. Damaged endothelial cells subsequently trigger hypercoagulability (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The abnormal activation of endothelial cells triggered by SARS-CoV-2 can further lead to cytokine storm and activation of the complement system, as described in the following sections.</p>
