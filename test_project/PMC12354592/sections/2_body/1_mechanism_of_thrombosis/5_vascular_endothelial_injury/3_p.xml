</xref>. In the renin&#8211;angiotensin system (RAS), Ang I is converted into Ang II by ACE-2 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Ang II-mediated AT1R activation can increase platelet activation and prevent fibrinolysis, resulting in a hypercoagulable state (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to have a direct effect on alveolar and systemic endothelial cells, causing endothelial dysfunction, altering the microvascular balance, and subsequently leading to organ ischemia, a procoagulation state, tissue inflammation and edema (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a distinct affinity for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as its cellular receptor. This receptor is expressed by type II alveolar cells and is situated in close proximity to the pulmonary vascular network (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) on endothelial cells, leading to endothelial cell damage (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). When SARS-CoV-2 binds to cells by ACE-2, the pulmonary expression of membrane-bound ACE-2 may be downregulated, leading to the accumulation of Ang II within cells. Ang II has various proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects and can be amplified in patients with COVID-19 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 directly infects vascular endothelial cells, leading to cell damage and apoptosis, thereby reducing the antithrombotic activity of normal endothelial cells.</p>
