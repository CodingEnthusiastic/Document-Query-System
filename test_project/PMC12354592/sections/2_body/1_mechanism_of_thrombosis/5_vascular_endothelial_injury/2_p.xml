Autopsies of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have shown evidence of endothelial cell apoptosis. The microvascular endothelial damage and microcirculation thrombus formation found in the autopsy assessment are consistent with the possible thrombotic microangiopathy that the patients may have (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The study also found that circulating endothelial cells (CEC), a cellular biomarker derived from damaged blood vessels, were elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 and in those with underlying conditions. Notably, even patients who recovered from COVID-19 had significantly higher numbers of circulating endothelial cells than healthy individuals, suggesting that vascular dysfunction persists after recovery from COVID-19 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
