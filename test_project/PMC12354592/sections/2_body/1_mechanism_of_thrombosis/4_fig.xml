It shows endothelial damage through ACE2 and PAR-2 pathways, leading to dysfunction, apoptosis, and hypercoagulability. A cytokine storm activates immune responses, while platelet and complement activation contribute to thrombus formation. Key components like spike protein, ACE2 receptors, and factors like IL-1&#945;, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; are highlighted. The diagram emphasizes the progression from endothelial damage to inflammation and immune activation, resulting in blood clot formation.</alt-text></graphic></fig>
