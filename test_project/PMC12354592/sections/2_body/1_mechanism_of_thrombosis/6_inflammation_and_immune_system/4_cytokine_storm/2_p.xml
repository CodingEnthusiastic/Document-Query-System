<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Cytokine storm syndrome has been documented in 10-20% of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and may result in severe outcomes, including multiorgan failure and mortality (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The cytokine storm and the consequent hyperinflammatory state determine local and systemic consequences, inducing arterial and venous vasculopathy in the lung with thrombosis of the small vessels and progression toward serious lung lesions, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and, in some cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 infection in the host lungs, upon entry through type 2 alveolar epithelial cells and interaction with blood vessels at the pneumocyte&#8211;capillary interface, causes the activation of host innate immunity, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which eventually results in an uncontrolled and exaggerated response, the cytokine storm (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Cytokine storm syndrome is associated with major thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19, and the mechanism is related primarily to the simultaneous stimulation of prothrombotic factors and inhibitory effects on fibrinolysis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>
