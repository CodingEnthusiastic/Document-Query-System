However, excessive activation of TLRs can disrupt intracellular signaling pathways, exacerbate the inflammatory response, and lead to an excessive and uncontrolled release of cytokines (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Firstly, activated macrophages and monocytes release a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, (IL)-1&#946;, and TNF-&#945; (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). In addition, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that facilitates the activation and mobilization of myeloid cells to inflammatory sites. It is synthesized by a variety of cell types. In patients with COVID-19, the production of GM-CSF initiates a positive feedback loop, leading to the overexpression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other proinflammatory factors, particularly by CD14+ and CD16+ inflammatory monocytes (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). In particular, TNF-&#945; and IL-6 levels increase to levels that are not typically observed in patients with bacterial sepsis or influenza (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In the context of inflammation, macrophages are stimulated to release TF in response to IL-6. The upregulation of the expression of IL-6 and its receptor in COVID-19 can lead to increased activation of endothelial cells, resulting in the excessive release of TF. This cascade of events can contribute to infection-induced coagulation dysfunction and increased platelet proliferation (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). IL-6 facilitates the secretion of various cytokines, activates immune cells, and contributes to the synthesis of specific coagulation factors, including fibrinogen and factor VIII. (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Moreover, IL-1&#945; is involved in the activation of the inflammatory cascade in thrombotic pathology and serves as a crucial factor in thrombosis through the recruitment of granulocytes, prolonging clot lysis time and increasing platelet activity (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Furthermore, the NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is responsible for the generation of six primary proinflammatory cytokines belonging to the interleukin-1 family, namely, IL-1&#946; and IL-18. NLRP3 inflammasome activation also increases immune thrombosis through mechanisms such as the release of neutrophil extracellular traps and TF by leukocytes, as well as the initiation of prothrombotic responses in platelets and the vascular endothelium (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Therefore, it has been suggested that cytokine release may also be the result of high levels of extracellular neutrophil traps.</p>
