<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Neutrophils, also known as polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, constitute the first line of defense in the innate immune system against invading pathogens. PMNs are the most abundant white blood cells in the human body and perform multiple protective functions, including phagocytosis of pathogens, degranulation, secretion of cytokines, and formation of NETs (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are complex, web-like structures consisting of DNA, histones, and antimicrobial proteins, which are extruded by activated neutrophils to ensnare and neutralize pathogens. Neutrophil elastase (NE), a constituent of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), plays a crucial role in platelet activation via the protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) and thrombin pathways, consequently altering platelet functionality and promoting fibrinogenesis. Additionally, myeloperoxidase (MPO), another integral component of NETs predominantly secreted by neutrophils, serves as a primary scavenger of the pro-oxidant hydrogen peroxide (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). The procoagulant properties of NETs are primarily attributed to their filamentous structures, which increase the adhesion of activated platelets and subsequently facilitate the entrapment of red blood cells (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>).</p>
