<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Excessive NET formation is a process known as NETosis, which can occur in patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, and can lead to hypercoagulation and thrombosis (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Research findings spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), in conjunction with C-type lectin member 2 (CLEC2), which is predominantly expressed in platelets and alveolar macrophages, is capable of directly interacting with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In contrast to filamentous neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the formation of aggregated NETs in the presence of wild-type (WT) platelets; however, this aggregation is absent in CLEC2-deficient platelets. Subsequent investigations have demonstrated that a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudolentivirus can induce NET formation via CLEC2, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD promotes NET formation by binding to CLEC2, thereby activating platelets (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). High levels of extracellular neutrophil traps can also contribute to the release of cytokines, which play crucial roles in thrombotic events in critically ill patients (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Significantly, NETs exacerbate lung damage by triggering epithelial cell and endothelial cell death, leading to the secretion of cytokines such as IL-1&#946; and IL-6, which initiate cytokine storms that exacerbate thrombosis (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). An intensified cycle of systemic and neutrophil-derived interleukin-8 (CXCL8/IL-8) dysregulation initiates and sustains neutrophil-driven immunopathology. This systemic positive feedback loop of neutrophil autocrine IL-8 results in an activated pre-thrombotic neutrophil phenotype, marked by degranulation and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In severe cases of COVID-19, neutrophils directly trigger coagulation and complement cascade reactions, underscoring their association with the immune thrombotic status observed in these patients (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). A study examining NETs and platelet involvement in the autopsies of lungs from 3 COVID-19 patients revealed that guanidino histone H3+ neutrophils might undergo NETosis and colocalize with platelet-derived thrombogenic factors in pulmonary microthrombi (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). The findings indicate that the interaction between neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and platelets in patients with COVID-19 may initiate a thrombogenic cascade, culminating in a hypercoagulable state and subsequent thrombosis. Research has demonstrated that NETs play a role in promoting the thrombotic factor vWF in a platelet-dependent fashion and directly activate the clotting cascade through mechanisms including platelet adhesion activation, cell&#8211;fibrinogen binding, and von Willeophilia. Furthermore, NETs have been found to contribute to local thrombin production, thereby increasing the risk of thrombosis in addition to their effect on primary hemostasis (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Furthermore, the colocalization of NETs with factor XII was confirmed, suggesting that NETs may serve as a platform for the activation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway involving factor XII (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>).</p>
