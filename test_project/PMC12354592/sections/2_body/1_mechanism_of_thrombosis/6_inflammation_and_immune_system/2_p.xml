During the course of COVID-19, the recruitment of immune cells and the subsequent production of proinflammatory cytokines serve as mediators of clotting activation in tissues affected by the virus. Viral infection triggers an inflammatory response in the host, leading to an increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines have pleiotropic effects, including activation of coagulation and thrombin generation, and this phenomenon is known as thromboinflammation or immunothrombosis. The main mechanisms are cytokine storm, complement system activation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which constitute the &#8220;malignant triangle&#8221; of immune-related thrombosis. The inflammatory and immune thrombosis-related mechanisms is shown in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">
