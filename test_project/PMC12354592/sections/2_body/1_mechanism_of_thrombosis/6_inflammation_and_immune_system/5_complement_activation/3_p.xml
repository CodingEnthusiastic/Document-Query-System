<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, complement system dysregulation has been observed, which is primarily characterized by disturbances in the terminal complement system and the persistent activation of both the alternative and classical complement pathways (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The NP of SARS-CoV-2 can bind to mannose-binding lectin serine protease 2 (MASP 2), a key component of the complement system, which exacerbates tissue damage and leads to the release of inflammatory factors, thereby increasing cell adhesion and thrombosis during long-term COVID-19 (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). In instances of thrombotic inflammation, the complement pathway may initiate the coagulation cascade through the induction of tissue factor expression. The activation of the complement cascade may also recruit and activate white blood cells, leading to the local release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and interferon gamma, which are significantly amplified and subsequently cause microvascular damage (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Compared with normal lung tissues, the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients display complement system hyperactivation, characterized by extensive deposition of C3, C3b/iC3b/C3d, and C5b-9 and the increased expression of the complement regulatory proteins CD55 and CD59 (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). In Addition, serine proteases within the lectin pathway are capable of cleaving prothrombin to generate activated thrombin. This mechanism is particularly evident in critically ill COVID-19 patients experiencing symptomatic thromboembolism, where there is a marked elevation of mannose-binding lectin (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Research has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein activates the complement alternative pathway by disrupting the function of complement factor H, a critical negative regulatory component of this pathway. Inhibitors targeting C5 and factor D have been shown to effectively prevent the accumulation of C5b-9 complexes induced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). The activation of the complement stem in COVID-19 patients results in the formation of a terminal complement complex (TCC) consisting of C5b-9. Among them, C5b-9 is regarded as one of the key factors affecting the hemostasis system in the quantitative system immunology model (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Furthermore, the insertion of the complement C5b&#8211;C7 complex into the endothelial cell membrane results in cellular damage, which subsequently triggers the release of vWF and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). This process is highly prothrombotic, as the resulting vWF polymers facilitate platelet recruitment and thrombin generation while simultaneously inducing C3b binding and activating alternative complement pathways. This feedback mechanism perpetuates localized complement activation and inflammation and the formation of microthrombi (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). C5a plays a pivotal role in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, while simultaneously enhancing the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and platelets. This process can result in elevated production of interleukin-6 and CXCL8, subsequently initiating a robust procoagulant response. Consequently, this leads to the formation of neutrophil-derived tissue factors and the development of the neutrophil extracellular trap (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Furthermore, the complement components C5a and the membrane attack complex facilitate platelet adhesion by inducing the secretion of endothelial P-selectin and vWF polymers, increasing the expression of TF and promoting platelet shedding, thereby contributing to thrombogenesis (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).</p>
