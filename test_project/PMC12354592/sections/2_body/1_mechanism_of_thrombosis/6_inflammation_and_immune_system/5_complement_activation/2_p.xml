<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The complement system serves as the primary defense mechanism against pathogen invasion and damage to host cells and consists of a complex network that includes over 40 soluble and membrane-binding proteins. This finely tuned response is typically maintained at low levels of activity in individuals who are in good health, allowing for a rapid and localized response to insults as they arise. The complement system operates through three distinct pathways&#8212;classical, lectin, and alternative&#8212;to provide comprehensive protection against invading pathogens (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The complement system serves as the primary immune response of the host to infection, but uncontrolled activation can lead to increased cellular damage, inflammation, and intravascular clotting and ultimately results in multiple organ failure and mortality (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>).</p>
