<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Various mechanisms explain platelet activation in patients with COVID-19. The first mechanism is related to the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the resulting cytokine storm and endothelial dysfunction (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). IL-1, IL-6, platelet-activating factor (PAF), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), P-selectin and vWF released by endothelial cells are all powerful activators of platelets that increase the binding of platelets to endothelial cells, thereby further inducing platelet activation and aggregation and leading to a progressively stronger effect; this mechanism may even induce DIC and thrombocytopenia. SARS-CoV-2 can enter endothelial cells through the ACE-2 receptor, CD147, toll-like receptors (TLRs), or C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) and platelets through the pericellular region. Subsequently, platelet activation leads to the release of platelet granules, the overexpression of TF, the formation of platelet leukocyte aggregates, and the formation of NETs (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>).Moreover, the imbalance between vWF and ADAMTS-13 is related to platelet activation. An elevated vWF/ADAMTS-13 ratio may indicate an acquired ADAMTS-13 deficiency, which results in the retention of larger circulating vWF molecules and increases the risk of platelet binding and microthrombosis (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Once activated, platelets secrete a vast repertoire of bioactive molecules, such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane A2 (TXA-2) and proinflammatory cytokines, from their intracellular granules that play essential roles in thrombus formation and inflammation (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). There is evidence that increased platelet response during SARS-CoV-2 infection is, at least in part, mediated by increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The activation of MAPK in platelets induces the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), which results in thromboxane synthesis (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>).</p>
