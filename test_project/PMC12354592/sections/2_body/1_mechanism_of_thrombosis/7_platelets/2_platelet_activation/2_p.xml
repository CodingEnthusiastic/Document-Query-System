<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Platelets have long been recognized for their crucial role in thrombi and the hemostatic system, as they rapidly respond to pathogens, signaling nearby immune cells and facilitating thrombosis and intravascular clot formation (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). The inflammation caused by viral infection can stimulate platelets to express TF, thereby promoting the interaction between platelets and monocytes and the formation of more platelet&#8211;monocyte aggregates that promote coagulation (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Platelets from COVID-19 patients exhibit a hyperactive phenotype (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Compared with those from healthy individuals, platelets from COVID-19 patients, including those with severe disease, are more sensitive to aggregation in response to low concentrations of agonists, such as thrombin and collagen (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A high proportion, approximately 90%, of individuals with COVID-19 were shown to exhibit increased platelet aggregation, elevated platelet activation, platelet&#8211;monocyte aggregation and formation, and increased levels of fibrinogen and collagen diffusion (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces greater platelet reactivity. The platelet hyperactivity mechanisms is shown in <xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">

</xref>. Research has indicated that hyperplatelet activity persists for a minimum of 40 days in the majority of COVID-19 patients, irrespective of the severity of the disease, following the resolution of acute inflammation. The sustained elevation in platelet activity after recovery from COVID-19 may predispose patients to thromboembolic complications (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>).and results in an increased platelet reaction in the context of this particular illness, a phenomenon known as &#8220;fibrinolysis shutdown&#8221; (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>).</p>
