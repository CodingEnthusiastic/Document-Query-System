Such sera can induce a procoagulant phenotype in platelets derived from healthy donors. This mechanism can be triggered not only by antibody-mediated pathways but also by immune complexes (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Immune complexes, which are soluble antigens formed through the binding of antibodies, serve as a crucial initial defense mechanism against pathogenic infections. In the context of COVID-19, these complexes consist of spike proteins from the virus and their corresponding antibodies. The interaction between immune complexes and platelet receptors triggers the activation of platelets and the release of intracellular molecules, including serotonin. This particular immune complex facilitates platelet activation and thrombosis in COVID-19, resembling the pathophysiological process observed in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Research has elucidated the mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein (S1) induces platelet activation. Specifically, IgG antibodies bind to the S1 protein to form immune complexes, which enhance the expression of the Fc&#947;RIIa receptor on platelets, facilitating receptor cross-linking. This process initiates platelet activation and aggregation, leading to the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs). Consequently, this mechanism directly contributes to the prothrombotic environment observed in COVID-19 (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>).</p>
