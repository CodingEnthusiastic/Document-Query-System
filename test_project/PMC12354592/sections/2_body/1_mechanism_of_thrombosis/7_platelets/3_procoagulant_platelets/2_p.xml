<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Procoagulant platelets are a subset of activated platelets that expose phosphatidylserine (PS) and promote thrombin production (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). Studies have shown that the &#916;&#936;m depolarization, cytosolic Ca2+ and PS externalization levels of platelets from COVID-19 patients in the ICU are high and that the expression of apoptosis markers is upregulated. Serum and immunoglobulin (IgG) fractions isolated from COVID-19 patients can induce the apoptosis of platelets from healthy donors, followed by changes in the coagulation system (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). Similarly, another study demonstrated a significant elevation in the levels of phosphorylated AKT in the platelets of COVID-19 patients, which was associated with CD62p expression and PS externalization. Notably, procoagulant thrombopoiesis induced by serum from COVID-19 patients in the ICU occurs independently of GPllb/llla. Furthermore, the inhibition of AKT and PI3K protein phosphorylation effectively prevented the production of procoagulant platelets. Thus, targeting PI3K/AKT phosphorylation may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate the risk of thrombosis in patients with severe COVID-19 (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>).</p>
