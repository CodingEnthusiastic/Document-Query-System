Numerous drug-related clinical trials have been undertaken to prevent thrombosis, and guidelines for its prevention and treatment are continuously evolving as our understanding of the disease progresses. This article provides a comprehensive review of the mechanisms underlying thrombosis in COVID-19 patients, as well as the advancements in clinical trials and guidelines for thrombosis prevention with pharmacological interventions.</p></abstract>
