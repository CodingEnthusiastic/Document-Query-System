It is particularly prevalent in intensive care unit settings, affecting up to 80% of ventilated patients. This study investigates whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) delirium aligns with expectations of non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium incidence in other hospitalized patients and identifies unique or common factors contributing to delirium in these groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 107 hospitalized patients diagnosed with delirium, comprising 56 COVID-19 patients and 51 non&#x02013;COVID-19 patients. Data were collected through detailed medical record reviews and structured interviews with patients and their caregivers to evaluate factors associated with delirium.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The findings revealed a higher prevalence of medication-related stressors in COVID-19 delirium compared to non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium. This suggests that overmedication may play a critical role in the development of delirium, regardless of the underlying critical illness condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the significant association between medication stressors and COVID-19 delirium.

Patients may develop delirium in hospital settings due to the severity of their illness and factors such as sedation, immobilization, cerebral metabolic insufficiency, neuroinflammation, imbalances in neurotransmitter levels, and disruptions in network connectivity [<xref rid="b2-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Delirium is the most frequent form of brain dysfunction associated with critical illness and occurs in approximately 60% to 80% of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation and in 20% to 50% of those who are hospitalized but not ventilated [<xref rid="b2-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This condition poses a significant clinical challenge for healthcare providers, and its high prevalence underscores the importance of managing it in clinical settings [<xref rid="b4-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Delirium significantly affects health outcomes, particularly in adults and the elderly, where it is linked to higher mortality rates during and after hospitalization [<xref rid="b5-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Delirium not only increases mortality but also brings additional challenges. It causes significant psychological and physical burden on effected individuals, and additionally, places a considerable burden on healthcare systems, amplifying existing pressures and complicating the management of patients conditions [<xref rid="b6-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This condition is multifactorial and it is influenced by both predisposing factors such as elderly, cognitive impairments, frailty, medical and psychiatric conditions, alcohol consumption, poor nutrition, and sensory impairments, and precipitating factors like acute medical illness, surgery, dehydration or drug effects. These elements combine to determine an individual's susceptibility to delirium [<xref rid="b7-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Delirium is one of the neuropsychiatric manifestations observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [<xref rid="b9-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a viral disease that, as of April 7, 2024, has resulted in over 704 million confirmed cases and more than 7 million fatalities worldwide [<xref rid="b10-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Common manifestations of this disease include fever, cough, altered sense of taste and olfactory disturbances, dyspnea, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, various other symptoms such as cutaneous manifestations, cardiovascular involvement, and neurological manifestations including coma, encephalopathy, and delirium have been reported [<xref rid="b11-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a recent review study, it was found that delirium manifested in approximately 30% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 [<xref rid="b13-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Studies have shown that the incidence of delirium in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is higher than in non&#x02013;COVID-19 patients within the same ICU setting [<xref rid="b12-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b14-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="b16-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Older age, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, as well as the use of certain medications, are identified as key risk factors for delirium in COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="b17-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In COVID-19 pandemic, the strong desire to actively combat COVID-19 has resulted in the overmedication and extensive use of drugs that lack proven effectiveness for its treatment [<xref rid="b18-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Polypharmacy can lead to a higher medication burden and is associated with an increased risk of adverse drug reactions, decreased quality of life, drug-drug interactions, and medication errors [<xref rid="b19-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, polypharmacy itself has been recognized as a risk factor for the development of delirium [<xref rid="b21-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], further complicating the management of COVID-19 patients.</p><p>This neuropsychiatric condition in COVID-19 patients was correlated with higher mortality rates, tripling the risk of death compared to those not experiencing delirium [<xref rid="b13-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given that delirium in COVID-19 patients is independently linked to higher mortality rates [<xref rid="b22-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] identifying stressors and implementing strategies to minimize its occurrence are crucial. Given the higher prevalence of COVID-19 delirium and the associated increase in mortality and morbidity, investigating the contributing factors and stressors of COVID-19 delirium during the pandemic is crucial. Our primary goal in this study is to examine delirium and its associated stressors in the context of an unknown, emerging disease compared to established well-known diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences (No. IR.IUMS.REC.1399.1040). Informed consent was obtained from all participants or, if they were unable, from a first-degree relative (legally authorized representative) after they received a comprehensive explanation of the study's objectives, the methods to be used, and their rights as participants. Participant privacy was strictly protected by anonymizing the data to prevent any identification of the individuals involved (<xref rid="f1-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The text of this article has been reviewed by artificial intelligence (AI; GPT-4o) for grammar, fluency, and language enhancement after its completion.

Randomly selected hospitalized patients at a university-based hospital; from 2021 to 2022, who required psychiatric consultation for signs of delirium and whose diagnosis was confirmed by a psychiatrist were included. Delirium diagnosis was made based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria [<xref rid="b1-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], using medical history and mental status tests. Patients were randomly selected from those seeking consultation for delirium to mitigate selection bias. A random sampling method was employed to minimize selection bias, with numbers assigned to eligible patients and a random number generator used for selection. Patients were categorized into two groups: COVID-19 delirium and non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on symptoms, PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) test results, and chest computed tomography findings.</p><p>Inclusion criteria included patients were hospitalized and diagnosed with delirium based on DSM-5 criteria. Exclusion criteria were as follows. (1) Patients with an uncertain diagnosis of delirium. (2) Patients with multiple diagnoses, including both COVID-19 and non&#x02013;COVID-19 conditions leading to hospitalization. Additionally, patients who contracted COVID-19 during their hospitalization were also excluded. (3) Patients with at least two stressor information missing, or those we could not contact to complete their data for any reason, were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection</title><p>Data were collected on patient age, sex, education level, delirium signs, medications being taken at the time of delirium onset, substance abuse history, medical history, and psychiatric history from their medical records. Total mortality included both in-hospital mortality and mortality after a 6-month follow-up. Patients were followed up during hospitalization and after 6 months. Any patients with incomplete data were excluded from the study. Standardized protocols were utilized to ensure consistency and minimize information bias across all subjects.</p><p>Data was categorized as follow. (1) Age: 60 years or older was considered a stressor. (2) Education: lack of education was considered a stressor. (3) Medications: use of 5 or more medications was considered a stressor. (4) Substance abuse: presence of a substance abuse history in the medical records was considered a stressor. (5) Psychiatric history: the presence of at least one psychiatric condition such as personality disorders, anxiety disorders, psychosis, mood disorders, or other disorders based on DSM-5 was considered a stressor. (6) Medical history: having at least one medical condition was classified as a stressor, whereas patients reporting no medical conditions were categorized as not having a medical stressor.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the differences between COVID-19 and non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium and to determine the differentiating criteria between the two groups. The analysis was performed using R (version 4.4.1) with R Studio (version 2024.04.2-764). Data manipulation was conducted with the "dplyr" and "rlang" packages, while "ggplot2" was used for data visualizations. For numerical data, we used the mean and standard deviation to describe normally distributed data, and proportions to summarize categorical data. The chi-square test was employed to determine whether the frequencies in each category were statistically different from each other. Stressors and In-hospital mortality rates were analyzed using a chi-square test, and differences in age between the groups were evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. To identify the predictor stressor that differentiates COVID-19 delirium from non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium, multivariate analyses using generalized linear model regression analysis was performed. In this study, a decision tree approach as a computational method to analyze the retrospective data was employed. Unlike traditional statistical methods that might rely on predefined assumptions and manual analyses, a decision tree is a machine learning algorithm that automatically identifies patterns and complex relationships within the data. We utilized the R software and the rpart package to construct and analyze the decision tree model. This involved steps such as data loading, model building using stressors to predict whether a case of delirium was COVID-19 delirium or non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium, and visualizing the resulting tree. The use of a decision tree allowed us to explore potential non-linear relationships and interactions between variables and to develop a data-driven predictive/classification model, which distinguishes our approach from a typical retrospective study that might primarily rely on descriptive or inferential statistical analyses. The relationship between the stressor and the dependent variable was simultaneously examined using these models, while the influence of potential confounding factors was controlled. By adjusting for multiple predictor variables, including confounders, the specific effect of the stressor was isolated. We applied the rpart() function, specifying the model formula, dataset, and method parameters. The importance of each variable in the model were assessed. Medications were categorized into the following groups: corticosteroids, antibiotics/antivirals, cardiovascular medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sedatives, psychotropic medications, anticholinergics, and others. A generalized linear model was then used to assess the relationships between these medication categories and COVID-19 versus non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 119 delirium patients were randomly selected. Twelve patients were excluded due to incomplete information, lack of consent, or unwillingness to participate and 107 patients were included in the study. Among them, 56 patients were hospitalized due to COVID-19, with a mean age of 64.8 years (standard deviation [SD], 16.7 years), and the remaining 51 patients were hospitalized due to other causes, with a mean age of 61.7 years (SD, 21.9 years). These other causes included multiple traumas, sepsis, encephalitis, suicide attempts, acute coronary syndrome, seizures, and postoperative conditions. Information on drug consumption, education, and medical history was incomplete for a subset of patients. However, these individuals were not excluded from the study because their remaining data were considered sufficient for analysis. Patients with at least two stressor information missing, or those we could not contact to complete their data for any reason, were excluded. Demographic information of the participants is presented in <xref rid="t1-acc-004944" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Age comparisons between the two groups indicated no significant difference (W=1,468, P=0.805) (<xref rid="f2-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The number of medications was compared between the two groups, and the results showed a significantly higher number of medications among COVID-19 patients compared to non&#x02013;COVID-19 patients (mean, 9.63; SD, 4.13 in COVID-19 patients vs. median, 3; range, 0&#x02013;11 in non&#x02013;COVID-19 patients; P=5.15 &#x000d7;10&#x0207b;&#x000b9;&#x000b2;) (<xref rid="f3-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The presence of medication stressors was compared between the two groups and the result revealed a significantly higher number of individuals with medication stressors among COVID-19 patients compared to non&#x02013;COVID-19 patients (92.3% in COVID-19 patients vs. 19.1% in non&#x02013;COVID-19 patients P=1.91 &#x000d7;10&#x0207b;&#x000b9;&#x000b3;) (<xref rid="f4-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Substance stressor was also significantly more prevalent among non&#x02013;COVID-19 patients (8.9% in COVID-19 vs. 37.2% in non&#x02013;COVID-19 patients, P=0.0004) (<xref rid="f5-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). No significant difference in educational, psychiatric, or medical stressors was found between the two groups (P-value in order=0.54, 0.18, and 0.45) (<xref rid="f6-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The observed total mortality rate was higher in the non&#x02013;COVID-19 patient group than in the COVID-19 patient group, with rates of 35.2% and 21.4%, respectively. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.11) (<xref rid="f7-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>A (generalized) linear model regression analysis was performed to identify the predictor stressor that differentiates COVID-19 delirium from non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium. The analysis aimed to ascertain which stressor could be used to predict whether a case of delirium was COVID-19 delirium or not. The variables included as potential stressors in the analysis were age stressor, medication stressor, substance stressor, psychiatric stressor, and medical stressor. It was found through the regression analysis that the presence of substance and medication stressors were significantly associated with the delirium classification as either COVID-19 delirium or non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium among patients. As previously indicated, it was observed that the prevalence of substance stressor was significantly higher in non&#x02013;COVID-19 patients.</p><p>Conversely, the presence of patients with medication stressor was significantly more frequent in COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="t2-acc-004944" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Analysis of the decision tree indicates that the presence of the medication stressor is the most significant factor in differentiating COVID-19 delirium and non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium (<xref rid="f8-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the significance of each predictor in the model can be assessed using the variable. The result showed that the medication stressor emerged as the most influential predictor (variable importance=19.796), following the substance stressor (4.525), the age stressor (3.394), and the medical stressor (2.262), are arranged in decreasing order of importance, respectively (<xref rid="t3-acc-004944" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). To differentiate between medication categories, a generalized linear model was used to assess the relationship between various medications and COVID-19 vs. non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium. The results showed a significant positive relationship between corticosteroids and antibacterial/antiviral medications and COVID-19 delirium, highlighting the potential role of these medications in the development of delirium in COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="t4-acc-004944" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

This condition imposes significant psychological, physical, and systemic burdens, complicating patient management and intensifying pressures on healthcare systems [<xref rid="b6-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b8-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b23-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of nine studies showed that delirium was observed in 27% of COVID-19 patients and was independently associated with a higher mortality rate among critically ill COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized [<xref rid="b15-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Considering the complications associated with delirium in patients, an important question arises: how can we reduce its incidence? Among the factors that increase the risk of delirium are various medications [<xref rid="b7-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Do critically ill patients experience delirium primarily because of their severe medical conditions, or is it due to the overmedication often prescribed for critically ill patients? The results of our study indicated that medication stressors could distinguish between COVID-19 delirium and non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium. Although both groups experienced critical conditions, medication stressor was still a factor that could separate these two groups. This suggests that overmedication in COVID-19 patients, independent of their critical condition, can be a factor that flares up delirium.</p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, the novel disease induced widespread fear, affecting everyone, including medical staff, who were urgently seeking effective treatments. Consequently, a variety of drugs such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, immune boosters, antiretrovirals, anti-inflammatories, and etc. were prescribed, often irrationally, before their effectiveness was definitively established. This led to overmedication in many patients [<xref rid="b18-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b24-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Overmedication among older adults often leads to several adverse effects, including increased risk of medication errors and drug interactions, falls, urinary incontinence, weight loss, frailty, cognitive impairment, and episodes of delirium. Consequently, this practice complicates the management of patient care and contributes to rising healthcare expenditures [<xref rid="b21-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A study involving 602 patients, investigated the outcomes of various treatment strategies for delirium in individuals averaging 71.6 years of age. The findings revealed that a more severe and persistent form of delirium was associated with a higher frequency of psychotropic drug use [<xref rid="b25-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Numerous drugs administered to critically ill patients are linked to the onset of delirium. These include analgesics, anticholinergics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, corticosteroids, sedatives, dopaminergic agents, prokinetics, antihistamines, and cardiac medications. The mechanisms through which these drugs may induce delirium include GABAminergic activity, anticholinergic effects, disruptions in serotonin function, elevated dopaminergic or glucocorticoid activity, and other yet unidentified processes [<xref rid="b26-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Given the significant role of medication stressors in the development of delirium, it is essential to focus on non-pharmacological interventions to reduce its incidence. Key nonpharmacological interventions for delirium prevention and management include minimizing unnecessary transfers between wards or rooms, assessing patients' delirium risk, providing cognitive stimulation, ensuring adequate hydration, promoting mobility, managing pain, addressing sensory impairments, and maintaining proper sleep hygiene. Specific interventions may involve reorientation techniques (e.g., providing clocks and calendars), encouraging regular mobility and active exercises, resolving reversible sensory impairments (e.g., ensuring availability and proper use of hearing aids and glasses), and fostering restful sleep by minimizing nighttime disruptions [<xref rid="b27-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Multi-component interventions have been shown to be more effective in preventing delirium compared to single-component interventions. The most effective combination of interventions includes proper sleep hygiene and cognitive stimulation, combined with pain control, mobilization, and patient assessment [<xref rid="b28-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Implementing these interventions can help mitigate delirium risk and improve overall patient outcomes, especially in vulnerable populations such as those with COVID-19.</p><p>In summary, our findings emphasize the critical need for vigilant medication management in hospitalized patients, particularly those with COVID-19 who face a higher burden of medication stressors. By minimizing unnecessary medications and implementing close monitoring of pharmacological treatments, healthcare providers can potentially reduce the incidence of delirium and improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.</p><p>This study highlights the critical role of medication stressors in differentiating between COVID-19 delirium and non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium. Our findings indicate that patients experiencing COVID-19 delirium exhibit a significantly higher burden of medication stressors compared to those with non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium. This distinction underscores the importance of careful medication management in hospitalized patients, particularly in the context of COVID-19. Given the established link between delirium and increased mortality and morbidity, it is imperative to adopt strategies aimed at minimizing the number of medications prescribed. Implementing thorough monitoring and control of pharmacological treatments can potentially reduce the incidence of delirium in this vulnerable population.</p><p>This study's strengths include the application of advanced statistical techniques, such as generalized linear models and decision trees, offers a nuanced understanding of the distinctions between COVID-19 and non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium, providing actionable insights. However, this study has several limitations. As a single-center study with a limited sample size, the findings should be interpreted with caution, as they may not fully represent broader patient populations. Additionally, the cross-sectional design does not allow for causal conclusions, and the exclusion of patients with incomplete data could introduce some degree of selection bias.</p><p>Future studies should aim to validate these findings using larger, multi-center cohorts to enhance generalizability. Longitudinal designs would be particularly valuable to better assess the progression and causal relationships of delirium in COVID-19 patients over time. Additionally, incorporating diverse patient populations across various healthcare settings would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors and ensure findings are applicable to a wider range of clinical scenarios.</p></sec><sec><title>KEY MESSAGES</title><boxed-text position="float"><p>&#x025aa; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with delirium consumed more medication than non&#x02013;COVID-19 patients.</p><p>&#x025aa; Medication consumption differentiates COVID-19 delirium from non&#x02013;COVID-19 delirium.</p><p>&#x025aa; Minimizing prescribed drugs is suggested in hospitalized patients.</p></boxed-text></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
