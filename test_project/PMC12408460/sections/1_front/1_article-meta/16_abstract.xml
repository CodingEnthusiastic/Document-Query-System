<abstract xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><sec><title>Background</title><p>Delirium is an acute condition marked by disturbances in cognition, awareness, and attention, commonly observed in hospitalized patients due to factors such as illness severity and medication. It is particularly prevalent in intensive care unit settings, affecting up to 80% of ventilated patients. This study investigates whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) delirium aligns with expectations of non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium incidence in other hospitalized patients and identifies unique or common factors contributing to delirium in these groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 107 hospitalized patients diagnosed with delirium, comprising 56 COVID-19 patients and 51 non&#8211;COVID-19 patients. Data were collected through detailed medical record reviews and structured interviews with patients and their caregivers to evaluate factors associated with delirium.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The findings revealed a higher prevalence of medication-related stressors in COVID-19 delirium compared to non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium. This suggests that overmedication may play a critical role in the development of delirium, regardless of the underlying critical illness condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the significant association between medication stressors and COVID-19 delirium. These findings emphasize the importance of minimizing unnecessary medications and closely monitoring pharmacological treatments to reduce delirium incidence and improve outcomes in hospitalized populations.</p></sec></abstract>
