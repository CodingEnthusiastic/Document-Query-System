<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The aim of this study was to investigate the differences between COVID-19 and non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium and to determine the differentiating criteria between the two groups. The analysis was performed using R (version 4.4.1) with R Studio (version 2024.04.2-764). Data manipulation was conducted with the "dplyr" and "rlang" packages, while "ggplot2" was used for data visualizations. For numerical data, we used the mean and standard deviation to describe normally distributed data, and proportions to summarize categorical data. The chi-square test was employed to determine whether the frequencies in each category were statistically different from each other. Stressors and In-hospital mortality rates were analyzed using a chi-square test, and differences in age between the groups were evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. To identify the predictor stressor that differentiates COVID-19 delirium from non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium, multivariate analyses using generalized linear model regression analysis was performed. In this study, a decision tree approach as a computational method to analyze the retrospective data was employed. Unlike traditional statistical methods that might rely on predefined assumptions and manual analyses, a decision tree is a machine learning algorithm that automatically identifies patterns and complex relationships within the data. We utilized the R software and the rpart package to construct and analyze the decision tree model. This involved steps such as data loading, model building using stressors to predict whether a case of delirium was COVID-19 delirium or non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium, and visualizing the resulting tree. The use of a decision tree allowed us to explore potential non-linear relationships and interactions between variables and to develop a data-driven predictive/classification model, which distinguishes our approach from a typical retrospective study that might primarily rely on descriptive or inferential statistical analyses. The relationship between the stressor and the dependent variable was simultaneously examined using these models, while the influence of potential confounding factors was controlled. By adjusting for multiple predictor variables, including confounders, the specific effect of the stressor was isolated. We applied the rpart() function, specifying the model formula, dataset, and method parameters. The importance of each variable in the model were assessed. Medications were categorized into the following groups: corticosteroids, antibiotics/antivirals, cardiovascular medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sedatives, psychotropic medications, anticholinergics, and others. A generalized linear model was then used to assess the relationships between these medication categories and COVID-19 versus non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium.</p>
