<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This observational cross-sectional study focused on patients with delirium. Randomly selected hospitalized patients at a university-based hospital; from 2021 to 2022, who required psychiatric consultation for signs of delirium and whose diagnosis was confirmed by a psychiatrist were included. Delirium diagnosis was made based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria [<xref rid="b1-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], using medical history and mental status tests. Patients were randomly selected from those seeking consultation for delirium to mitigate selection bias. A random sampling method was employed to minimize selection bias, with numbers assigned to eligible patients and a random number generator used for selection. Patients were categorized into two groups: COVID-19 delirium and non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on symptoms, PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) test results, and chest computed tomography findings.</p>
