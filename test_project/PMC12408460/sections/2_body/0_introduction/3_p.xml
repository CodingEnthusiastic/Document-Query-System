<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This neuropsychiatric condition in COVID-19 patients was correlated with higher mortality rates, tripling the risk of death compared to those not experiencing delirium [<xref rid="b13-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given that delirium in COVID-19 patients is independently linked to higher mortality rates [<xref rid="b22-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] identifying stressors and implementing strategies to minimize its occurrence are crucial. Given the higher prevalence of COVID-19 delirium and the associated increase in mortality and morbidity, investigating the contributing factors and stressors of COVID-19 delirium during the pandemic is crucial. Our primary goal in this study is to examine delirium and its associated stressors in the context of an unknown, emerging disease compared to established well-known diseases.</p>
