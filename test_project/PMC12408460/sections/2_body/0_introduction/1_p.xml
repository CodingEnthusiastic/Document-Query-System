<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Delirium is an acute, fluctuating condition characterized by disturbances in cognition, awareness, and attention which is arising from another medical condition and not attributable to an existing neurocognitive disorder [<xref rid="b1-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Patients may develop delirium in hospital settings due to the severity of their illness and factors such as sedation, immobilization, cerebral metabolic insufficiency, neuroinflammation, imbalances in neurotransmitter levels, and disruptions in network connectivity [<xref rid="b2-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Delirium is the most frequent form of brain dysfunction associated with critical illness and occurs in approximately 60% to 80% of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation and in 20% to 50% of those who are hospitalized but not ventilated [<xref rid="b2-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This condition poses a significant clinical challenge for healthcare providers, and its high prevalence underscores the importance of managing it in clinical settings [<xref rid="b4-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Delirium significantly affects health outcomes, particularly in adults and the elderly, where it is linked to higher mortality rates during and after hospitalization [<xref rid="b5-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Delirium not only increases mortality but also brings additional challenges. It causes significant psychological and physical burden on effected individuals, and additionally, places a considerable burden on healthcare systems, amplifying existing pressures and complicating the management of patients conditions [<xref rid="b6-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This condition is multifactorial and it is influenced by both predisposing factors such as elderly, cognitive impairments, frailty, medical and psychiatric conditions, alcohol consumption, poor nutrition, and sensory impairments, and precipitating factors like acute medical illness, surgery, dehydration or drug effects. These elements combine to determine an individual's susceptibility to delirium [<xref rid="b7-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
