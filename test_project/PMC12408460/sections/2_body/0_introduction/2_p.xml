Common manifestations of this disease include fever, cough, altered sense of taste and olfactory disturbances, dyspnea, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, various other symptoms such as cutaneous manifestations, cardiovascular involvement, and neurological manifestations including coma, encephalopathy, and delirium have been reported [<xref rid="b11-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a recent review study, it was found that delirium manifested in approximately 30% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 [<xref rid="b13-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Studies have shown that the incidence of delirium in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is higher than in non&#8211;COVID-19 patients within the same ICU setting [<xref rid="b12-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b14-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="b16-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Older age, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, as well as the use of certain medications, are identified as key risk factors for delirium in COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="b17-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In COVID-19 pandemic, the strong desire to actively combat COVID-19 has resulted in the overmedication and extensive use of drugs that lack proven effectiveness for its treatment [<xref rid="b18-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Polypharmacy can lead to a higher medication burden and is associated with an increased risk of adverse drug reactions, decreased quality of life, drug-drug interactions, and medication errors [<xref rid="b19-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, polypharmacy itself has been recognized as a risk factor for the development of delirium [<xref rid="b21-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], further complicating the management of COVID-19 patients.</p>
