<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Considering the complications associated with delirium in patients, an important question arises: how can we reduce its incidence? Among the factors that increase the risk of delirium are various medications [<xref rid="b7-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Do critically ill patients experience delirium primarily because of their severe medical conditions, or is it due to the overmedication often prescribed for critically ill patients? The results of our study indicated that medication stressors could distinguish between COVID-19 delirium and non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium. Although both groups experienced critical conditions, medication stressor was still a factor that could separate these two groups. This suggests that overmedication in COVID-19 patients, independent of their critical condition, can be a factor that flares up delirium.</p>
