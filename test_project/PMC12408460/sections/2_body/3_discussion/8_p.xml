However, this study has several limitations. As a single-center study with a limited sample size, the findings should be interpreted with caution, as they may not fully represent broader patient populations. Additionally, the cross-sectional design does not allow for causal conclusions, and the exclusion of patients with incomplete data could introduce some degree of selection bias.</p>
