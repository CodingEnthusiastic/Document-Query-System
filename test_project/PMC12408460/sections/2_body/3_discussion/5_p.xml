Key nonpharmacological interventions for delirium prevention and management include minimizing unnecessary transfers between wards or rooms, assessing patients' delirium risk, providing cognitive stimulation, ensuring adequate hydration, promoting mobility, managing pain, addressing sensory impairments, and maintaining proper sleep hygiene. Specific interventions may involve reorientation techniques (e.g., providing clocks and calendars), encouraging regular mobility and active exercises, resolving reversible sensory impairments (e.g., ensuring availability and proper use of hearing aids and glasses), and fostering restful sleep by minimizing nighttime disruptions [<xref rid="b27-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Multi-component interventions have been shown to be more effective in preventing delirium compared to single-component interventions. The most effective combination of interventions includes proper sleep hygiene and cognitive stimulation, combined with pain control, mobilization, and patient assessment [<xref rid="b28-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Implementing these interventions can help mitigate delirium risk and improve overall patient outcomes, especially in vulnerable populations such as those with COVID-19.</p>
