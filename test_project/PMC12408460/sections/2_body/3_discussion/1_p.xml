The results indicate a significantly higher prevalence of substance stressors among the non&#8211;COVID-19 patients. In contrast, medication stressors were notably more common among the COVID-19 patients. Importantly, the presence of medication stressors emerged as the most significant differentiating factor between COVID-19 delirium and non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium, serving as the most influential predictor of the condition's occurrence. Between different medication categories, corticosteroids and antibacterial/antiviral medications were significantly associated with COVID-19 delirium.</p>
