<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, the novel disease induced widespread fear, affecting everyone, including medical staff, who were urgently seeking effective treatments. Consequently, a variety of drugs such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, immune boosters, antiretrovirals, anti-inflammatories, and etc. were prescribed, often irrationally, before their effectiveness was definitively established. This led to overmedication in many patients [<xref rid="b18-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b24-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Overmedication among older adults often leads to several adverse effects, including increased risk of medication errors and drug interactions, falls, urinary incontinence, weight loss, frailty, cognitive impairment, and episodes of delirium. Consequently, this practice complicates the management of patient care and contributes to rising healthcare expenditures [<xref rid="b21-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A study involving 602 patients, investigated the outcomes of various treatment strategies for delirium in individuals averaging 71.6 years of age. The findings revealed that a more severe and persistent form of delirium was associated with a higher frequency of psychotropic drug use [<xref rid="b25-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Numerous drugs administered to critically ill patients are linked to the onset of delirium. These include analgesics, anticholinergics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, corticosteroids, sedatives, dopaminergic agents, prokinetics, antihistamines, and cardiac medications. The mechanisms through which these drugs may induce delirium include GABAminergic activity, anticholinergic effects, disruptions in serotonin function, elevated dopaminergic or glucocorticoid activity, and other yet unidentified processes [<xref rid="b26-acc-004944" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
