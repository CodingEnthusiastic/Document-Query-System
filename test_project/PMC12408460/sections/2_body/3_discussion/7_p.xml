Our findings indicate that patients experiencing COVID-19 delirium exhibit a significantly higher burden of medication stressors compared to those with non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium. This distinction underscores the importance of careful medication management in hospitalized patients, particularly in the context of COVID-19. Given the established link between delirium and increased mortality and morbidity, it is imperative to adopt strategies aimed at minimizing the number of medications prescribed. Implementing thorough monitoring and control of pharmacological treatments can potentially reduce the incidence of delirium in this vulnerable population.</p>
