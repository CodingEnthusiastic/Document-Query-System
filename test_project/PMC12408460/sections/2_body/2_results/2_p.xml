Substance stressor was also significantly more prevalent among non&#8211;COVID-19 patients (8.9% in COVID-19 vs. 37.2% in non&#8211;COVID-19 patients, P=0.0004) (<xref rid="f5-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). No significant difference in educational, psychiatric, or medical stressors was found between the two groups (P-value in order=0.54, 0.18, and 0.45) (<xref rid="f6-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The observed total mortality rate was higher in the non&#8211;COVID-19 patient group than in the COVID-19 patient group, with rates of 35.2% and 21.4%, respectively. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.11) (<xref rid="f7-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
