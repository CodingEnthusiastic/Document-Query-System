<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A (generalized) linear model regression analysis was performed to identify the predictor stressor that differentiates COVID-19 delirium from non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium. The analysis aimed to ascertain which stressor could be used to predict whether a case of delirium was COVID-19 delirium or not. The variables included as potential stressors in the analysis were age stressor, medication stressor, substance stressor, psychiatric stressor, and medical stressor. It was found through the regression analysis that the presence of substance and medication stressors were significantly associated with the delirium classification as either COVID-19 delirium or non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium among patients. As previously indicated, it was observed that the prevalence of substance stressor was significantly higher in non&#8211;COVID-19 patients.</p>
