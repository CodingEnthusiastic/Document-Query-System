Twelve patients were excluded due to incomplete information, lack of consent, or unwillingness to participate and 107 patients were included in the study. Among them, 56 patients were hospitalized due to COVID-19, with a mean age of 64.8 years (standard deviation [SD], 16.7 years), and the remaining 51 patients were hospitalized due to other causes, with a mean age of 61.7 years (SD, 21.9 years). These other causes included multiple traumas, sepsis, encephalitis, suicide attempts, acute coronary syndrome, seizures, and postoperative conditions. Information on drug consumption, education, and medical history was incomplete for a subset of patients. However, these individuals were not excluded from the study because their remaining data were considered sufficient for analysis. Patients with at least two stressor information missing, or those we could not contact to complete their data for any reason, were excluded. Demographic information of the participants is presented in <xref rid="t1-acc-004944" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Age comparisons between the two groups indicated no significant difference (W=1,468, P=0.805) (<xref rid="f2-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The number of medications was compared between the two groups, and the results showed a significantly higher number of medications among COVID-19 patients compared to non&#8211;COVID-19 patients (mean, 9.63; SD, 4.13 in COVID-19 patients vs. median, 3; range, 0&#8211;11 in non&#8211;COVID-19 patients; P=5.15 &#215;10&#8315;&#185;&#178;) (<xref rid="f3-acc-004944" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
