The result showed that the medication stressor emerged as the most influential predictor (variable importance=19.796), following the substance stressor (4.525), the age stressor (3.394), and the medical stressor (2.262), are arranged in decreasing order of importance, respectively (<xref rid="t3-acc-004944" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). To differentiate between medication categories, a generalized linear model was used to assess the relationship between various medications and COVID-19 vs. non&#8211;COVID-19 delirium. The results showed a significant positive relationship between corticosteroids and antibacterial/antiviral medications and COVID-19 delirium, highlighting the potential role of these medications in the development of delirium in COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="t4-acc-004944" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).
