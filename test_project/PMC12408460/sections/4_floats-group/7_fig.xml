The decision tree identifies the presence of a medication stressor as the most significant factor distinguishing the two groups. In each split, the left branch represents cases that meet the condition (Yes), and the right branch represents those that do not meet the condition (No). Node numbers are automatically assigned by the analysis software and may not be sequential.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="acc-004944f8" position="float"/></fig>
