It is particularly prevalent in intensive care unit settings, affecting up to 80% of ventilated patients. This study investigates whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) delirium aligns with expectations of non-COVID-19 delirium incidence in other hospitalized patients and identifies unique or common factors contributing to delirium in these groups.<h4>Methods</h4>An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 107 hospitalized patients diagnosed with delirium, comprising 56 COVID-19 patients and 51 non-COVID-19 patients. Data were collected through detailed medical record reviews and structured interviews with patients and their caregivers to evaluate factors associated with delirium.<h4>Results</h4>The findings revealed a higher prevalence of medication-related stressors in COVID-19 delirium compared to non-COVID-19 delirium. This suggests that overmedication may play a critical role in the development of delirium, regardless of the underlying critical illness condition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study highlights the significant association between medication stressors and COVID-19 delirium. These findings emphasize the importance of minimizing unnecessary medications and closely monitoring pharmacological treatments to reduce delirium incidence and improve outcomes in hospitalized populations.", "affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Faculty of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Delirium", "Polypharmacy", "Covid-19"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.4266/acc.004944"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12408460"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12408460?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by-nc", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2025-09-03", "firstIndexDate": "2025-09-04", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2025-09-08", "dateOfRevision": "2025-09-06", "electronicPublicationDate": "2025-07-21", "firstPublicationDate": "2025-07-21"}
