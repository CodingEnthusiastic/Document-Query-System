Greenhawt et&#160;al. reported a very low incidence of vaccine&#8208;associated anaphylaxis (7.91 per million doses) [<xref rid="rcr270274-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), including polyethylene glycol and polysorbate, have been implicated in vaccine&#8208;induced hypersensitivity and inflammatory reactions [<xref rid="rcr270274-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
