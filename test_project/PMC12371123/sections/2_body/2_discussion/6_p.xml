<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">COVID&#8208;19 mRNA vaccines encode the spike protein receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, prompting its expression on host cells to generate an immune response. The production of anti&#8208;RBD antibodies not only protects against infection but may also enhance innate immunity. These antibodies may contribute to exaggerated immune responses, including systemic inflammation. Bergamaschi et&#160;al. reported that the second dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine led to a sharp rise in cytokine levels, such as TNF&#8208;&#945; and IL&#8208;6. Other studies have associated COVID&#8208;19 vaccination with autoimmune manifestations and cytokine release syndrome. Together, these findings suggest that vaccination can stimulate various immune pathways, potentially leading to allergic&#8208;like reactions and vaccine&#8208;related pneumonitis.</p>
