<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Analysis of circulating cytokines revealed markedly elevated IL&#8208;8, IL&#8208;6, and TNF&#8208;&#945; levels. In contrast, IL&#8208;5, which plays a key role in allergic eosinophilic inflammation, was not elevated. However, the patient's IgE level was mildly elevated, suggesting a partial allergic response. Elevated IL&#8208;8 has been reported in IgE&#8208;mediated lung disease [<xref rid="rcr270274-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], supporting the possibility of an overlapping allergic component.</p>
