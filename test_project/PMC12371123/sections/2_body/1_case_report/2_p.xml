He had no history of chronic interstitial lung disease and allergies. He had received his third dose of the COVID&#8208;19 vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer) 2&#8201;days prior. Computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple ground&#8208;glass opacities with traction bronchiectasis in both lungs (Figure&#160;<xref rid="rcr270274-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A&#8211;C</xref>). On admission, his body temperature was 37.4&#176;C, and oxygen saturation was 95% on nasal oxygen at 4&#8201;L/min. Significant pathogens were not detected and the quantitative test for COVID&#8208;19 antigen was negative (Table&#160;<xref rid="rcr270274-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Chlamydophila pneumonia IgG and IgA were both positive, but the result indicated past infection (Table&#160;<xref rid="rcr270274-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). His condition deteriorated in the emergency department, with oxygen saturation barely reaching 90% despite 10&#8201;L/min oxygen; therefore, invasive mechanical ventilation was initiated, and steroid pulse therapy was administered. As the aetiology of pneumonitis was unclear, antibiotic therapy (pazufloxacin, 1000&#8201;mg twice daily) was started under the suspicion of atypical pneumonia. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).</p>
