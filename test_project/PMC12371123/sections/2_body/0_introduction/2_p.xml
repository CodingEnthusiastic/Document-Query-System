The global pandemic and social disruption prompted the accelerated clinical application of COVID&#8208;19 vaccines worldwide [<xref rid="rcr270274-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since December 8, 2020, emergency use authorisation of mRNA vaccines (such as BNT162b2 (Pfizer&#8208;BioNTech) and mRNA&#8208;1273 (Moderna)) has been granted, and vaccination became compulsory in many countries. COVID&#8208;19 mRNA vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe COVID&#8208;19 and have contributed to pandemic control. However, the vaccines were rapidly approved, and unlike other investigational drugs, limited safety data had been accumulated. According to clinical trial data, most vaccine&#8208;associated adverse events are mild [<xref rid="rcr270274-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; however, severe adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis, myocarditis, and thrombotic events have also been reported [<xref rid="rcr270274-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These events can be fatal, and their mechanisms remain poorly understood. Pneumonitis following COVID&#8208;19 vaccination is rare.</p>
