<p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We report a case of severe pneumonitis as an adverse event of COVID&#8208;19 vaccination. The patient recovered after steroid pulse therapy. His blood cytokine data before admission were examined. There have been few reports of cytokine analysis in acute vaccine&#8208;related adverse events (AEs). We hope our report contributes to future cytokine research and therapy for vaccine&#8208;related AEs.</p>
