We examined his serum cytokine levels: TNF&#945; was 1.2&#8201;pg/mL, IL&#8208;6 was 156&#8201;pg/mL, and IL&#8208;8 was 75.0&#8201;pg/mL. The patient developed severe respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support but recovered after steroid pulse therapy.<boxed-text position="anchor" content-type="graphic" id="rcr270274-blkfxd-0001"><graphic xlink:href="RCR2-13-e70274-g003.jpg" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-1"/></boxed-text>
