COVID&#8208;19 mRNA vaccination was mandatory in many countries for a period; however, severe adverse events have been observed in some individuals who received the vaccine. We report a case of COVID&#8208;19 mRNA vaccine&#8208;induced pneumonitis in a male patient whose cytokine levels were analysed prior to admission. His serum IgE level was high (347&#8201;U/mL), and several cytokines were elevated: TNF&#945; was 1.2&#8201;pg/mL, IL&#8208;6 was 156&#8201;pg/mL, and IL&#8208;8 was 75.0&#8201;pg/mL. The patient developed severe respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support but recovered after steroid pulse therapy.</p></abstract>
