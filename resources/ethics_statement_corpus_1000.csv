The data were then divided into a training/validation data set and a test data set depending on the time of admission (training/validation data set: n = 134,961, between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2015; test data set: n = 38,616, between January 1, 2016 and December 26, 2017). Admission cases under 18 years of age were excluded from both data sets, while the admission cases of those 18 years of age or older were defined as eligible cases for the analysis as shown in  Fig 1. Variables with > 25% missing data or variables not suitable for developing the prediction model in the training/validation set were also excluded from the analysis. The anonymous patient’s ID, hospitalization time, and alkaline phosphatase value displayed in King-Armstrong unit were excluded from the remaining variables. Because alkaline phosphatase values in IU/l were included in the data, we removed the values with King-Armstrong unit. Ultimately, 25 variables, specifically, age, sex, 21 laboratory variables, length of stay, and mortality, were considered eligible for analysis. Subsequently, cases that were missing all variables of eligible laboratory data were excluded.

Data on cardiovascular risk factors (anthropometric data, including BMI, physiological measurements such as blood pressure, biochemical measurements) were recorded. Physical activity and alcohol consumption (standard drinks/day) were collected using validated questionnaires. For additional information on the physical activity questionnaire, please see the online supplement. Follow-ups were performed in 3-year intervals until 1992 (1980, 1983, 986, 1989, and 1992), and additional follow-ups with more extensive measurements were organised in 2001 and 2007 ( Figure 1)  15.

The study population has been described in a former study  18. CKD was defined according to KDIGO criteria  19. CKD was regarded ‘stable’ if the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, MDRD formula) differed ≤5 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 within the past 12 months. We refrained from including subjects with a higher deterioration of eGFR in order to reliably exclude any states of acute on chronic kidney injury. Exclusion criteria were obstructive uropathy, urothelial carcinoma, metastatic cancer, and pyuria. Etiological entities were categorized in primarily inflammatory renal diseases (glomerulonephritis, vasculitis; group 1, IRD) and primarily non-inflammatory diseases (diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease ADPKD, and ‘others’; group 2, NIRD). This categorization was done despite the fact that inflammatory mechanisms are of relevance in the pathogenesis of these entities as well. The mechanisms, however, can contribute to the progression of the diseases but do not initiate them and do not necessitate immunosuppression. Glomerulonephritis/vasculitis comprised subjects with lupus nephritis, crescentic glomerulonephritis due to polyangiitis with granulomatosis, membranous glomerulonephritis, IgA-nephropathy and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis in Schönlein–Henoch purpura, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and glomerulonephritis of unknown origin.

Informed consent was obtained written from all participants and/or legal representatives (if they have been nominated by the German guardianship court) for the approval of laboratory work with the patient samples used. The informed consent procedures were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee. For the study, 85 patients (between 44 and 86 years old) were recruited who underwent a prostate biopsy due to diagnostic confirmation of prostate enlargement and elevated PSA levels. The samples were collected between 02/2014 and 02/2015 at the Clinic for Urology and Paediatric Urology of the  Helios Klinikum Wuppertal and immediately stored at -80°C. From the participants, 10 ml urine, 5 ml saliva and 2 x 9 ml blood samples were obtained. The samples were taken during the routine blood collection in the inpatient stay. No separate punctures were necessary. In addition, the core clinical data of their prostate disease were recorded, listed as results in  Table 1. Exclusion criteria for study participation were inability to actively consent to the study, infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, hepatitis, TB, etc.), urinary diversion using intestinal segments, saliva-reducing diseases, radiation therapy of the small pelvis or a history of anti-androgenic therapy.

Of the 85 patient samples, a selection was made according to the integrity of the patient data. Since a comparison of other miRNA extraction methods was carried out at least 8 ml of urine per patient was required for the inclusion of the samples. As a result, 53 patient samples could be selected and processed, 28 with prostate carcinoma and 25 with benign prostate hyperplasia. For the main evaluation, 15 samples (BPH) were compared with 18 samples (PCa) and the results were again validated against the remaining samples (n = 20). Since there have been no previous studies on this concrete issue, we were missing the variances of the individual miRNAs and the expected differences between the two groups. So, we could not make a valid power-calculation in advance and relied on the assessment of the resident statisticians (n>40).

Due to the absence of the co-substrate binding and transmembrane domains the truncated enzyme is inactive, as published previously  14. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), Trieste, Italy. At 60 days after birth, the mice were randomized and a single administration of rSV-h UGT1A1 (n = 7) or rSV-HLP-h UGT1A1 (n = 8) or a PBS injection control (n = 7) by tail vein injection, 3 mice with dose of 2x10 11 vg/kg, and 4–5 mice with dose of 1.7x10 12 vg/kg, respectively. Intravenous of rSV40 was performed under isoflurane anesthesia. No surgical or other procedures requiring anesthesia were performed. Animals were treated by researchers trained for animal care and monitored daily for general appearance. No signs of stress (lack of appetite, body weight loss, hair loss, stereotypic or aggressive behavior, etc.) or macroscopic alterations of vital functions were observed throughout the experimental phase. Blood was sampled at 1, 3, 5 and 8 weeks after vector administration by facial vein puncture and collected in EDTA-containing tubes.

Outcome assessors were blinded to the HP results. The primary outcomes were measurable changes in daily on-off time, L-dopa onset and peak time that result from successful HP eradication. The secondary outcomes were changes in clinical symptoms and the quality of life scores. All participants were verbally explained regarding the study before signing the consent form.

Participants were recruited through convenience sampling and consisted of 48 university students (M = 22.8 years, SD = 2.8) including 32 females and 16 males. Notably, the majority of the participants were in the younger age range, which may limit the generalizability of the results to the older population. To the best of our knowledge, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that tyrosine (administered as a single dose) produces differential effects on the cognitive performance of younger versus older healthy participants. A study looking at the effects of habitual daily tyrosine intake (i.e., looking at the long-term effects of tyrosine) on cognition in younger and older adults demonstrated that both groups responded in a similar way to higher daily intake of tyrosine (i.e., both groups reported benefits in measures of fluid intelligence, working memory, and episodic memory)  36.
