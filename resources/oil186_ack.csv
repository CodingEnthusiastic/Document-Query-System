In general, the roots contain the highest level of elements followed by stems, leaves, flowers, buds and fruits of the different maturity stages. Nevertheless, uptake of elements by a plant is influenced by various factors, including the type of plant, nature of the soil, climate and agricultural practices [  36 ]. In the current study, the different elemental concentrations were varied due to the above factors.   A. sowa  L. root accumulated a significant amount of minerals in Bangladeshi geo-environmental condition. The results are also compared with the reported [  8 ] data of   Anethum graveolens  L. root where K (38,500 ppm) had the highest value, Ca (12,200 ppm) and Mg (6700 ppm) had the lowest values than our current study. The elements, especially Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe and Al play a significant role in human metabolism and the life processes. The rich amount of Ca is important because of its role in bones, teeth, muscle system and heart functions [  37 ]. Mg has been particularly shown to play a significant role as a regulatory cation in direct and indirect traumatic brain injury [  38 ]. Another report on Mg, it also helps in preventing some heart disorders and high blood pressure [  39 ]. Recently, it has been reported that trace amounts of Rb and Cs help in the breakdown of starch to glucose [  36 ]. Cs was present in the trace amount (21.53 ppb) in the present study. Se has anti-oxidising function and it is essential for providing the organism with triiodothyroxine produced from thyroxine [  40 ]. It contributes to the maintenance of cellular antioxidative balance when taken up at the recommended dietary allowance of 50–100 μg/day and tolerable upper intake limit is 400 μg/day [  41 ]. The high dosage of selenate has been shown to normalize hyperglycemia [  36 ]. Li is another element with beneficial pharmacological properties which effectively used in the treatment of manic depressive disorders [  42 ]. The result also showed that many of these elements have vital importance in human metabolism for growth, developments and also prevention and healing of diseases. The non-essential or toxic elemental contents in spice and medicinal plants are attracting attention to the scientist and also the food chemist due to its adverse effect on the human body in respect of medicinal and food preparation. The permissible limits of Hg and As are 1 and 10 mg/kg in foodstuff respectively [  43 ]. The maximum prescribed limit of Cd is 0.3 mg/kg for herbal medicines and its product while the dietary intake limit is 10.3 mg/kg as per who recommendation [  44 ]. Moreover, the toxic elements were found below the prescribed limits in the present experiment. Nonetheless, excessive intake can cause poisoning in the human body. Hg poisoning can result in damage to the brain, kidney, lungs including acrodynia (pink disease), Hunter-Russell syndrome and Minamata disease [  45 ]. The acute sign of As poisoning includes fever, anorexia, hepatomegaly, cardiac arrhythmia, transient encephalopathy and irritation of the gastrointestinal tract [  46 ]. Cd intoxication can lead to kidney, bone and pulmonary damages [  47 ]. Pb and Cd cause both acute and chronic poisoning, adverse effects on the kidney, liver, heart, vascular and immune system [  48 ]. Furthermore, root parts of   Anethum sowa  L. herb is not usually consumed, it is wasted mostly. The present investigation will be helpful for Ayurvedic and pharmaceutical industries to assess the essential and toxic elemental level for medicinal preparation.",['for providing'],1,['Se has anti-oxidising function and it is essential for providing the organism with triiodothyroxine produced from thyroxine [  40 ].'],[[]],[[]],[[]],[[]],[['for providing']]

Sucrose was the main sugar in   Bouskri  unlike other varieties which contain fructose and glucose in high amount.   Bouskri  contains the highest amount of pyridoxine and   Majhoul  possesses the highest amount niacin and riboflavin. Among analyzed cultivars,   Bousthammi  contains the highest amount of magnesium and manganese and has iron seven times more than   Jihl  cultivars, which contains a high amount of calcium and copper. The highest amount of zinc was found in   Najda  while the highest amount of potassium was detected in   Bouskri . Significant difference in antioxidant activity was observed between analyzed varieties. The highest antioxidant activity was observed in both   Bousrdoun  and   Jihl  which contained the highest amount of phenolic and flavonoids content. Gallic, Ferulic, Caffeic acids and Rutin were the most dominant among analysed polyphenolic compounds and the highest amount of these compounds were observed in   Jihl  and   Bousrdoun.  Regarding the anti-inflammatory activity and based on the results of three in vitro assays and two in vivo assays,   Bousrdoun  and   Jihl  exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory effect. Moderate antibacterial activity was observed in all studied varieties except Bouskri and Majhoul which didn’t show no antibacterial effect against the six bacterial strains.   Bousrdon  and   Jihl  were found to be more potent against these bacterial strains. These differences in chemical composition and biological activity suggest that date fruit is an extensive domain hence the size should not be the only character that should be used to choose the variety but also its composition and their biological activities.

So, in the present study, the antioxidant capacity of   Cl EO was evaluated using DPPH radical scavenging method by comparing with the activity of the Ascorbic acid as a known antioxidant. The DPPH test aims at measuring the capacity of the essential oil to scavenge the stable free radical DPPH  .  by donation of hydrogen atom or an electron [  23 ]. If the extracts have the capacity to scavenge the DPPH free radical, the initial blue/purple solution will change to a yellow colour due to the formation of diphenylpicrylhydrazine. The effect of the different   Cl EO on DPPH radical scavenging was compared to those of ascorbic acid, used as positive control, and appreciated by the determination of the IC  50  values. As shown in Fig.   1 , DPPH test revealed that the free radical-scavenging activity was a dose dependent manner. From the analysis of Fig.   1 , we can conclude that the radical-scavenging activity of the   Cl EO and positive controls ascorbic acid increased with increasing concentration (  P  <0.05).

Although both pathways are thought to operate independently under normal conditions, interactions between them have been repeatedly reported [  18 ]. Thus, experiments with labelled products and/or treatments with specific inhibitors (mevinoline and fosmidomycin that respectively block the MVA and MEP pathways) illustrate that the compartmental division between the two pathways is not complete since common metabolites from both pathways can be exchanged, in both directions, through the plastidial membrane [  11 ,  19 ,  20 ]. Therefore, the relative contribution of the MVA and MEP pathways for the biosynthesis of plant terpenes and the factors controlling this distribution especially under physiological conditions of growing plants remain uncertain for each plant species. It is still assumed, however, that monoterpenes are primarily synthesized in the plastids via the MEP pathway-derived IPP and DMAPP [  21 ].",['for providing'],1,"['Generally, it is assumed that the MVA pathway is responsible for providing precursors for the synthesis of sesquiterpenes and triterpenes, while the MEP pathway donates precursors for monoterpenes, diterpenes and tetraterpenes [  17 ].']","[[MVA, MEP]]","[['ORG', 'ORG']]","[[34, 149]]","[[37, 152]]",[['for providing']]
