The procedures were approved by the Human Research Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand (ref. no. NONE-2560-05052). Firstly, 60 mL of whole blood was collected in heparinized tubes (1430 USP units). Furthermore, 15 mL of whole blood was transferred to a new 50 mL sterile tube, and then, 15 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.40) was added. Next, the solutions were gently mixed. Subsequently, 15 mL of Ficoll-hypaque (Lymphoprep™) was carefully injected into the bottom of the tube prior to centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 30 min. The PBMC fraction was then collected from the interphase and washed once with sterile PBS. The cell pellets were then resuspended in a red blood cell (RBC) lysing solution for 5 min. After that, the cells were washed twice with sterile PBS and then resuspended at a density of 1 × 10  6  cells/mL in an RPMI 1640 medium with L-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (BioMedia, Singapore).
