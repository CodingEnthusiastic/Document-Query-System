Since gelatinase is abundantly and specifically existed in most tumors, we have synthesized gelatinase-stimuli NPs by inserting the gelatinase-cleavable peptide Pro-Val-Gly-Leu-Iso-Gly (PVGLIG) into the bonding between polyethylene glycol (mPEG) and polycaprolactone (PCL) segments (mPEG-Pep-PCL) (Li et al.,   2013 ). The copolymer that we used has been approved by FDA, which signifies the potential of the NPs for clinical application. When NPs were accumulated in tumors, the mPEG-peptide-PCL conjugates would be cleaved by gelatinase. The de-PEGylated NPs aggregate to form large particles and therefore able to be retained in tumor region. Also, aggregated particles enter tumor cells by endocytosis which may increase the cellular uptake and further improve the intracellular concentration of anticancer drugs. Hence, these ‘smart’ NPs possess passive tumor-targeting capacity through microenvironment stimuli strategies. In our previous study, we have proved that the NPs were capable of Sal delivery with high encapsulation efficacy and tumor targeting property.   In vivo  experiment demonstrated superior CCSCs inhibition effect by attenuating the EMT pathway and milder adverse events evidenced by no obvious pathological changes in the H and E staining of organs, body weight variations, and survival (Wang et al.,   2014 ,   2020 ).",['approved by'],1,"['The copolymer that we used has been approved by FDA, which signifies the potential of the NPs for clinical application.']",[[FDA]],[['ORG']],[[48]],[[51]],[['approved by']]

Cerebral ischemic stroke is caused by a reduction in blood flow to the brain. In this disease, two major zones of injury are identified: the lesion core, in which cells rapidly progress toward death, and the ischemic penumbra (surrounding the lesion core), which is defined as hypoperfusion tissue where cells may remain viable and can be repaired. Two methods that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include intravenous thrombolytic therapy and endovascular thrombectomy, however, the narrow therapeutic window poses a limitation, and therefore a low percentage of stroke patients actually receive these treatments. Developments in stem cell therapy have introduced renewed hope to patients with ischemic stroke due to its potential effect for reversing the neurological sequelae. Over the last few decades, animal tests and clinical trials have been used to treat ischemic stroke experimentally with various types of stem cells. However, several technical and ethical challenges must be overcome before stem cells can become a choice for the treatment of stroke. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms, processes, and challenges of using stem cells in stroke treatment. We also discuss new developing trends in this field.

Evaluation of donor fundamentally assesses the risk of infectious disease transmission to the recipient and improves the quality of hematopoietic progenitors cell (HPC) product. It also minimizes the chances of adverse donor reactions during the donation process. Ideally, the donor evaluation should involve eliciting a detailed medical history, high-risk behavior, and psychosocial evaluation followed by a complete physical examination and a battery of investigation. Any abnormal finding would not necessarily lead to donor deferral but help the clinical team to closely access the risk versus benefit. It is mandatory to take informed written consent from all donors. Special considerations are taken in autologous patients and pediatric donors to obtain a good quality HPC product. A thorough review and evaluation of all vital organ function in the recipients should be completed to determine transplant eligibility. The disease status at the time of HSCT will help the physician determine the conditioning regimen to prescribe. Pre-transplant psychosocial risk factors are said to predict survival after HSCT. The hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index (HCT-CI) is a commonly used tool to score pre-transplant comorbidities that predict non-relapse mortality and survival. Patient and donor education is a vital part of care for HSCT patients, their families, and informal caregivers. Proper documentation of consents, procedures, and treatment plan should be done in compliance with regulatory guidelines.

To ensure safety of the product and the recipient, the donor is encouraged to maintain good personal hygiene to prevent infection.

The consent forms and educational material on HPC collection should be clearly written in a language understood by the donor. Thus, the informed consent is an integral part of donor evaluation.

Meanwhile, spleen was obtained to collect spleen cells, similar to the method of bone marrow cells, and the final concentration of spleen cells was adjusted to 3 × 10  7 /ml. On day 0, recipient BALB/c mice received total body irradiation with 8 Gy per mouse at a dose rate of 0.5 Gy/min. Four hours post-irradiation, mice were injected with 100 μl bone marrow cells and 100 μl spleen cells via tail vein. Mice in the exosomes injection group (  n  = 10) were injected with 200 μg exosomes per mouse via tail vein on the day of transplantation. After the treatment, the body weight and survival situation of mice were monitored every 3 days to plot body weight curve and survival curve, until death of animal or termination of the study on day 30. Meanwhile, five indicators, including body weight, activity, posture, skin texture, and hair removal, were scored as 0–2 based on severity, and the total scores were considered as the clinical score. The animals in different treatment groups were not randomly housed. The clinical scores of aGVHD mice were evaluated by two independent researchers in a blind way.","['animal study was reviewed and approved by', 'approved by', 'Ethics Committee']",3,['The animal study was reviewed and approved by Ethics Committee of Rizhao People’s Hospital.'],[[Ethics Committee of Rizhao People’s Hospital]],[['ORG']],[[46]],[[90]],"[['animal study was reviewed and approved by', 'approved by', 'Ethics Committee']]"

This work aims to evaluate the effects of the combined use of humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody capable of binding the IL-6 receptor (Tocilizumab), and umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UCT-MSC) in the treatment of a patient with severe COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (IUC) and submitted to mechanical ventilation.    Methods  This study is part of a project approved by the National Research Ethics Commission (CONEP); CAAE: 30833820.8.0000.0020. The patient had a diagnostic criterion for the severe acute respiratory syndrome resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 and received two 400 mg doses of tocilizumab, three infusions of 500,000 CTM / kg plus full anticoagulation. TCU-MSC were obtained from healthy donors. The following parameters were evaluated in the pre-infusion of cells (D1), on the day following each infusion (D2, D4, and D6), on the 14th and 60th day after the first infusion (D14 and D60): viral load, immune response (Regulatory T lymphocytes), C-reactive protein level in plasma, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, total lymphocyte count and subpopulations (platelets, inflammatory cells, and reticulocytes), TGO / TGP, increased prothrombin time, D-dimer, creatinine, troponin.    Results  The relative viral quantification decreased gradually from 1 (D1) to 0.06 (D6) RdRP / RNApol, undetectable in D14. An increase in the absolute number of total lymphocytes / µL has also been seen to have progressively increased from 281 (D1) to 954.9 (D6) and since then decreased to 641.6 in D60 in the same way as T lymphocytes 148.6 (D1) 642.6 (D6) 607.4 (D14) 485.7 (D60), CD4 T lymphocytes, 102 (D1) 481.2 (D6) 459.5 (D14) 358 (D60) and Treg lymphocytes 10.8 (D1) 34 (D6) 29.8 (D14), 25.9 (D60). Plasmablasts, in contrast, decreased from 52 (D1) to 4.5 (D6) to almost undetectable in D60 (0.2). Laboratory tests outside the reference values decreased during the follow-up from D1 to D14 were within the normal parameters at D60. The patient was extubated uneventfully on D6, discharged from the ICU on D10, and the hospital on D14.    Conclusion  the combined use of tocilizumab and MSC is safe, without adverse effects, and the results of this case report prove to be a promising alternative in the treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2.

All analyzed studies provide general information regarding the study’s aim, method, and collection of donor’s personal data and specimen. The information for participants in these studies adheres to general guidelines for research involving human subjects; however, in several areas fails to take into account the specific nature of research with iPSCs. The majority of analyzed studies fail to provide information about possible individual consequences connected with genetic research, such as the possibility of re-identification of the donor or incidental findings acquired during research. Missing is also information about the possibility of future studies involving reproductive research or transplantation of cells and organs.

Our analysis consists of a sample of eight studies conducted at two research institutions in Germany. Although the size of the sample is too small to provide generalized results with regard to other institutions or countries, it allows us a better understanding of the practice in the field of research with iPSCs and compliance with the ethical norms guiding such research. The size of the sample provides also an advantage—it allows detailed inspection of research protocols submitted to the Research Ethics Committee at Ulm University. To our knowledge, up to now, only one other investigation of such compliance with ethical guidance has been attempted (  Lowenthal et al., 2012 ).

Reflected should be a broad approach to consent, which includes the provision of specific information that allows study participants to individually evaluate the risks and benefits of partaking in the study. Although analyzed studies observe general rules of patient information, crucial disclosure of specific risks to patient’s privacy or ethically objectionable areas of future research are missing. Such shortcomings need to be alleviated in order to ensure the donor’s autonomy. Important is that the process of informed consent keeps pace with current developments in iPSCs research. However, comprehension of information should not be endangered through the provision of excessive details, which would decrease the general understanding of information and demotivate patients to participate in the study. Here, a balance between the donor’s rights and researchers’ interests needs to be achieved. Alternative methods of information, tailored to adult and non-adult participants, such as video animations, interactive consent modules or social media groups can support the comprehension of information materials without decreasing the extent of substantial disclosure.",['informed consent'],1,['Important is that the process of informed consent keeps pace with current developments in iPSCs research.'],[[]],[[]],[[]],[[]],[['informed consent']]

To generate miR-26a transgenic mice, a genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragment encoding the miR-26a-1 locus, preceded by the synthetic CAG promoter and a loxP-flanked Neo-STOP cassette, was inserted into the Rosa26 locus. Mice were generated by injecting targeted ES cells into blastocysts and maintaining in mixed C57BL/6 and 129 backgrounds. The mice carrying the targeted allele were bred with hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyl transferase-Cre mice, which caused the deletion of the Neo-STOP cassette early during embryogenesis, including the germline [  15 ,  16 ]. The miR-26a-OE  fl/fl  mice were crossed with CaMKIIα-Cre mice (Jackson lab, West Grove, USA) to generate miR-26a overexpression mice.

They exhibit greater potential for the treatment of nervous system diseases than other types of stem cells because of their neurogenic differentiation capability and their ability to secrete multiple neurotrophic factors. Few studies have reported Alzheimer’s disease treatment using dental pulp stem cells. Rat models of Alzheimer’s disease were established by injecting amyloid-β1–42 into the hippocampus. Fourteen days later, 5 × 10   6  dental pulp stem cells were injected into the hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry and western blot assays showed that dental pulp stem cell transplantation increased the expression of neuron-related doublecortin, NeuN, and neurofilament 200 in the hippocampus, while the expression of amyloid-β was decreased. Moreover, cognitive and behavioral abilities were improved. These findings indicate that dental pulp stem cell transplantation in rats can improve cognitive function by regulating the secretion of neuron-related proteins, which indicates a potential therapeutic effect for Alzheimer’s disease.

All participants gave informed consents before the study. The human hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from peripheral blood (80 ml) of healthy adult donors (  n  = 12). The peripheral blood was diluted with PBS in a ratio of 1:3. Subsequently, 20 ml of the peripheral blood was added into the Lymphocyte Separation Medium (Ficoll-Pague T Plus, 10 ml) and centrifuged at 400 g for 30 min. A pasteur pipette was used to transfer the middle layer of mononuclear cells into a centrifuge tube. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were washed with 40 ml of PBS and mechanically dissociated into single cell suspension. Next, Magic™ Fc Receptor Blocker (Abace Biotechnology) and 100 μL of magnetic beads of CD34  +  was added into the cell suspension and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. Finally, CD34  +  cells were collected using MS Columns and MiniMACS™ Separator. The early EPCs were differentiated from CD34  +  human hematopoietic stem cells. The CD34  +  cells at the density of 1 × 10  6  cells/cm  2  were seeded on fibronectin-coated dish and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO  2 . The FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Singapore) was used to detect the labeled EPCs in the peripheral blood and a CellQuest™ software (BD Biosciences) was used for quantification. Common endothelial cell lines used for the scientific research include human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), bovine aortic endothelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells.

To enhance the targeted delivery of exogenous stem cells to the injury site, cell therapy combined with neural tissue engineering technology is expected to become a new strategy for treating traumatic brain injury. Collagen/heparan sulfate porous scaffolds, prepared using a freeze-drying method, have stable physical and chemical properties. These scaffolds also have good cell biocompatibility because of their high porosity, which is suitable for the proliferation and migration of neural stem cells. In the present study, collagen/heparan sulfate porous scaffolds loaded with neural stem cells were used to treat a rat model of traumatic brain injury, which was established using the controlled cortical impact method. At 2 months after the implantation of collagen/heparan sulfate porous scaffolds loaded with neural stem cells, there was significantly improved regeneration of neurons, nerve fibers, synapses, and myelin sheaths in the injured brain tissue. Furthermore, brain edema and cell apoptosis were significantly reduced, and rat motor and cognitive functions were markedly recovered. These findings suggest that the novel collagen/heparan sulfate porous scaffold loaded with neural stem cells can improve neurological function in a rat model of traumatic brain injury.

NELL-1 is involved in upregulating runt-related transcription factor 2, a key transcription factor associated with osteoblast differentiation [  20 ,  40 ]. NELL-1 is activated through the mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway in pre-osteoblasts on titanium surfaces [  25 ]. NELL-1 is reported to bind to integrin β1, leading to the induction of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway [  5 ]. NELL-1 produced comparable osteogenic potency with bone morphogenic protein-2, which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration [  24 ]. However, NELL-1 is shown to enhance bone defect healing through recruitment of endogenous cells and induction of vascularization, which may differ from the mechanism of bone morphogenetic protein-2 [  15 ]. Moreover, NELL-1 has the additional advantage of not having the off-target effects commonly seen with bone morphogenetic protein-2, leading to wider application for small and large animal models [  41 ].",['approved by'],1,"['NELL-1 produced comparable osteogenic potency with bone morphogenic protein-2, which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration [  24 ].']",[[the Food and Drug Administration]],[['ORG']],[[100]],[[132]],[['approved by']]

The aim of this study was to compare the perianal fistula closure rates following treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents or autologous adipose tissue-derived stem cell (auto-ASC) transplantation with Crohn’s disease (CD).    Methods  CD patients who underwent seton placement for perianal fistula from January 2015 to December 2019 at a tertiary referral center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups, one that received sequential treatments with anti-TNF agents (anti-TNF group) and the other that underwent auto-ASC transplantation (stem cell group). Clinical variables and fistula closure rates were compared in the two groups.    Results  Of the 69 patients analyzed, 39 were treated with anti-TNF agents and 30 underwent auto-ASC transplantation. Compared with the stem cell group, patients in the anti-TNF group were older (    p =0.028), were more frequently male (    p =0.019), had fistulas with more penetrating behavior (    p =0.002), had undergone surgery more frequently (    p =0.010), and had a shorter interval from seton placement to intended treatment (    p <0.001). During a median follow-up of 46 months (range, 30–52.5 months), fistula closure rates were significantly faster (83.3% vs. 23.1%,     p <0.001), and the mean interval from seton placement to fistula closure significantly shorter (14 vs. 37 months,     p <0.001) in the stem cell than in the anti-TNF group. Three patients experienced fistula recurrence, all in the stem cell group.      Conclusions  Medical treatment using anti-TNF agents and auto-ASC transplantation are feasible treatment options after seton placement for Crohn’s perianal fistula. However, the closure rate was significantly faster and the time to closure significantly shorter in patients who underwent auto-ASC transplantation than medical treatment.

CD was diagnosed by gastroenterologists based on clinical, endoscopic, radiological, and histopathologic criteria according to the diagnostic guidelines for CD in Korea [  32 ]. There is no single gold standard for the diagnosis of CD and typical endoscopic findings of CD are non-continuous distribution of longitudinal ulcers, cobblestone mucosal appearance, and aphthous ulcerations arranged in a longitudinal fashion. The evaluation of small bowel with small bowel follow-through is recommended for suspected CD to establish diagnosis and to determine the extent and location of disease. Focal and patchy chronic inflammation, focal crypt irregularity, and non-caseating granulomas are usual microscopic features of CD. Patients who underwent examination under anesthesia, those without a detected fistula tract, patients with insufficient medical records, and those lost to follow-up were excluded. Patients were divided into an anti-TNF group and a stem cell group. The anti-TNF group included patients who received anti-TNF agent treatment for any purpose after seton drainage for perianal fistula. The stem cell group included patients who underwent auto-ASC transplantation after seton drainage for perianal fistula without receiving anti-TNF agents. The anti-TNF group therefore included patients who received at least one injection or infusion of anti-TNF agents within 3 months before or after surgery for treatment of perianal fistula, whereas the stem cell group excluded patients who received anti-TNF agents within 3 months before or after surgery for treatment of perianal fistula. Patients’ characteristics, including age, gender, smoking, and subclass of the Montreal classification [  33 ], were compared. The Montreal classification describes the age of onset, extent and behavior of CD in more detail (Table   1 ). Fistula evaluation included fistula type (simple vs. complex, single vs. multiple), perioperative CD medication (immunomodulators or steroids) without anti-TNF agents, presence of proctitis or stricture, and presence of perianal abscess. Anti-TNF agents used in this study were infliximab (Remicade®, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Horsham, PA, USA) and adalimumab (Humira®, AbbVie, Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA). Auto-ASC used in this study was Cupistem® (Anterogen Co.,Ltd, Seoul, South Korea). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center (No. 2020-1059).
