The mice were sacrificed at 8 weeks post-injection. Four-week-old male BALB/c nude mice were obtained from Central Lab. Animal Inc. (Seoul, Korea) and maintained under standard conditions until the experiments were performed. The animals were maintained at the animal facility of the Seoul National University Hospital under guidelines prior to the grouping and experiments. A total of 15 BALB/c nude mice were randomized into 3 groups: 1 normal, 2 143 cells transfected with an ad mock shRNA vector (Control), and 3 143 cells transfected with the ad EMMPRIN shRNA vector. Experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Seoul National University Hospital (approval number 10–0075). One anti-EMMPRIN sequence (5-GTCGTCAGAACACATCAAC-3) or a scrambled sequence was inserted into the plasmid vector pAdEasy-1 (Addgene). They were designated as pAdEasy-1-shRNA and pAdEasy-1 scramble shRNA, respectively. Osteosarcoma cell line 143B was transfected with EMMPRIN shRNA. EMMPRIN shRNA transfected 143B cells were harvested with trypsin, and then resuspended in serum-free RPMI, and injected in the tail vein (1 × 10 5/0.2 mL) of 5 nude mice per group. Health of the animals was monitored daily, and body weights were measured weekly throughout the study period. Anesthesia was performed with isoflurane inhalation as well as ketamine (10 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg) injection. All surgical procedures were performed under sterile conditions. Secondary euthanasia method for cervical dislocation was also performed. The mice were sacrificed by CO 2 inhalation at 8 weeks post-injection.
