The mouse model of aGVHD was established by allogeneic cell transplantation as previously described (  Lai et al., 2018 ). C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation method. The femur and tibia were taken and cut both sides, then the medullary cavity was repeatedly washed with PBS. The bone marrow cell suspension was filtered through a 40-μm filter and then centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. Red blood cell lysate was added to remove blood cells. After centrifugation, bone marrow cells were collected, and the final concentration was adjusted to 6 × 10  7 /ml. Meanwhile, spleen was obtained to collect spleen cells, similar to the method of bone marrow cells, and the final concentration of spleen cells was adjusted to 3 × 10  7 /ml. On day 0, recipient BALB/c mice received total body irradiation with 8 Gy per mouse at a dose rate of 0.5 Gy/min.

In Japan, the double examination system for research using human ES cells was also abolished, leaving the ethical aspects of research using human ES cells to the ethics committee of each research institution. For various reasons, the use of ES cells had been limited to basic research, as there have been ethical issues associated with breaking and separating fertilized eggs. However, in August 2006, Professor Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University succeeded in creating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by introducing several types of genes into the skin cells of adult mice [  4 ]. In November 2007, iPS cells derived from human cells were successfully produced [  5 ].

They exhibit greater potential for the treatment of nervous system diseases than other types of stem cells because of their neurogenic differentiation capability and their ability to secrete multiple neurotrophic factors. Few studies have reported Alzheimer’s disease treatment using dental pulp stem cells. Rat models of Alzheimer’s disease were established by injecting amyloid-β1–42 into the hippocampus. Fourteen days later, 5 × 10   6  dental pulp stem cells were injected into the hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry and western blot assays showed that dental pulp stem cell transplantation increased the expression of neuron-related doublecortin, NeuN, and neurofilament 200 in the hippocampus, while the expression of amyloid-β was decreased. Moreover, cognitive and behavioral abilities were improved. These findings indicate that dental pulp stem cell transplantation in rats can improve cognitive function by regulating the secretion of neuron-related proteins, which indicates a potential therapeutic effect for Alzheimer’s disease.

C:\Users\shweata\docanalysis\ethics_statement\../stem_cell_research_300\PMC8224125\sections\0_front\1_article-meta\21_abstract.xml," One reason for the poor therapeutic effects of stem cell transplantation in traumatic brain injury is that exogenous neural stem cells cannot effectively migrate to the local injury site, resulting in poor adhesion and proliferation of neural stem cells at the injured area. To enhance the targeted delivery of exogenous stem cells to the injury site, cell therapy combined with neural tissue engineering technology is expected to become a new strategy for treating traumatic brain injury. Collagen/heparan sulfate porous scaffolds, prepared using a freeze-drying method, have stable physical and chemical properties. These scaffolds also have good cell biocompatibility because of their high porosity, which is suitable for the proliferation and migration of neural stem cells. In the present study, collagen/heparan sulfate porous scaffolds loaded with neural stem cells were used to treat a rat model of traumatic brain injury, which was established using the controlled cortical impact method. At 2 months after the implantation of collagen/heparan sulfate porous scaffolds loaded with neural stem cells, there was significantly improved regeneration of neurons, nerve fibers, synapses, and myelin sheaths in the injured brain tissue. Furthermore, brain edema and cell apoptosis were significantly reduced, and rat motor and cognitive functions were markedly recovered. These findings suggest that the novel collagen/heparan sulfate porous scaffold loaded with neural stem cells can improve neurological function in a rat model of traumatic brain injury.

The aim of this study was to compare the perianal fistula closure rates following treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents or autologous adipose tissue-derived stem cell (auto-ASC) transplantation with Crohn’s disease (CD).    Methods  CD patients who underwent seton placement for perianal fistula from January 2015 to December 2019 at a tertiary referral center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups, one that received sequential treatments with anti-TNF agents (anti-TNF group) and the other that underwent auto-ASC transplantation (stem cell group). Clinical variables and fistula closure rates were compared in the two groups.    Results  Of the 69 patients analyzed, 39 were treated with anti-TNF agents and 30 underwent auto-ASC transplantation. Compared with the stem cell group, patients in the anti-TNF group were older (    p =0.028), were more frequently male (    p =0.019), had fistulas with more penetrating behavior (    p =0.002), had undergone surgery more frequently (    p =0.010), and had a shorter interval from seton placement to intended treatment (    p <0.001). During a median follow-up of 46 months (range, 30–52.5 months), fistula closure rates were significantly faster (83.3% vs. 23.1%,     p <0.001), and the mean interval from seton placement to fistula closure significantly shorter (14 vs. 37 months,     p <0.001) in the stem cell than in the anti-TNF group. Three patients experienced fistula recurrence, all in the stem cell group.      Conclusions  Medical treatment using anti-TNF agents and auto-ASC transplantation are feasible treatment options after seton placement for Crohn’s perianal fistula. However, the closure rate was significantly faster and the time to closure significantly shorter in patients who underwent auto-ASC transplantation than medical treatment.

CD was diagnosed by gastroenterologists based on clinical, endoscopic, radiological, and histopathologic criteria according to the diagnostic guidelines for CD in Korea [  32 ]. There is no single gold standard for the diagnosis of CD and typical endoscopic findings of CD are non-continuous distribution of longitudinal ulcers, cobblestone mucosal appearance, and aphthous ulcerations arranged in a longitudinal fashion. The evaluation of small bowel with small bowel follow-through is recommended for suspected CD to establish diagnosis and to determine the extent and location of disease. Focal and patchy chronic inflammation, focal crypt irregularity, and non-caseating granulomas are usual microscopic features of CD. Patients who underwent examination under anesthesia, those without a detected fistula tract, patients with insufficient medical records, and those lost to follow-up were excluded. Patients were divided into an anti-TNF group and a stem cell group. The anti-TNF group included patients who received anti-TNF agent treatment for any purpose after seton drainage for perianal fistula. The stem cell group included patients who underwent auto-ASC transplantation after seton drainage for perianal fistula without receiving anti-TNF agents. The anti-TNF group therefore included patients who received at least one injection or infusion of anti-TNF agents within 3 months before or after surgery for treatment of perianal fistula, whereas the stem cell group excluded patients who received anti-TNF agents within 3 months before or after surgery for treatment of perianal fistula. Patients’ characteristics, including age, gender, smoking, and subclass of the Montreal classification [  33 ], were compared. The Montreal classification describes the age of onset, extent and behavior of CD in more detail (Table   1 ). Fistula evaluation included fistula type (simple vs. complex, single vs. multiple), perioperative CD medication (immunomodulators or steroids) without anti-TNF agents, presence of proctitis or stricture, and presence of perianal abscess. Anti-TNF agents used in this study were infliximab (Remicade®, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Horsham, PA, USA) and adalimumab (Humira®, AbbVie, Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA).
